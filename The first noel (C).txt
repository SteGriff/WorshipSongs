THE FIRST NOEL (C)

    C     G         F          C
The First Noel, the angels did say
       C            G            F                 C
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
   C            Em        F             C
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
     C             G          F      C
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

	C     Em    F     C
	Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
	Am          Em      F     C    F    C
	Born is the King of Is-ra-el.

     C       G      F     C
They look-ed up and saw a star
        C      G       F         C
Shining in the east, beyond them far
    C      Em       F          C
And to the earth it gave great light
    C         G           F       C
And so it con-tinued both day and night

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

     C       G        Am       Em
Then entered in those Wise Men three
     F        C    F      C
full reverent-ly upon the knee
    C       Em        Am       G
and offered there, in his pres-ence
      F        C         F       C
their gold and myrrh and frankin-cense

	C     Em    F     C
	Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
	Am          Em      F     C    F    C
	Born is the King of Is-ra-el.
