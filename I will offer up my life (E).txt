I WILL OFFER UP MY LIFE

E                  A       B          E
I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
E                      A           B          E
Pouring out the oil of love, as my worship to you
E                   A       B     C#m
In surrender I must give my every part
                   A              B      E
Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart

	E                 A     B          E
	Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
					 A             B        E
	To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?
						A     B           E
	Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
						A            B               E
	As a praise of Your name for the things You have done?
	E                      F#m       E       A
	Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
		   F#m     E            A       B             E
	Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart

You deserve my every breath, for You've paid the great cost
Giving up your life to death, even death on the cross
You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
Open up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in
