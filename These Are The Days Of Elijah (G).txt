THESE ARE THE DAYS OF ELIJAH (G)
  
  G                     C
These are the days of Elijah,
    D                      G  C
Declaring the word of the Lord,
      G                         C
And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
 D                      G  
Righteousness being restored.
      Bm                                 Em
And though these are the days of great trials,
    C                        D
Of famine and darkness and sword,
       G                        C
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,
    Em7           D         G    
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"


        C       G                     C
        Behold he comes, riding on the clouds,
                          G                  D
        Shining like the sun at the trumpet call.
                      G                            C
        So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
                           G        D      G
        And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.

     G                       C
And these are the days of Ezekiel,
   D                       G   C
The dry bones becoming as flesh.
    G                        C 
And these are the days of Your servant, David,
   D                       G C
Rebuilding the temple of praise.
  Bm                          Em
And these are the days of the harvest,
   C                            D
The fields are as white in the world.
   G                             C
And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,
     Em           D         G
Declaring the word of the Lord!

	G                            C
	There's no one like Jehovah, there's no one like Jehovah,
	G                            D
	There's no one like Jehovah, there's no one like Jehovah.
