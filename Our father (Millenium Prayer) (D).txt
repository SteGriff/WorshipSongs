MILLENIUM PRAYER (D)

D                        A
Our Father who art in Heaven
D               G
Hallowed be thy name
D
Thy Kingdom come 
A                    G          D
thy will be done on earth as in heaven

Give us today our daily bread           D  A
And forgive our sins                    D  G
As we forgive each one of those         D  A
who sins against us                     G  D

And lead us not to the time of trial
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom the power and the glory

Let all the people sing Amen             
In every tribe and tongue                
Let every heart's desire be joined       
To see the kingdom come

Let every hope and every dream
Be born in love again
Let all the world sing with one voice
Let the people say amen
