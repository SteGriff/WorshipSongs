CREATE IN ME (E)

		A      E    B            C#m
	Cre-ate in me a clean, clean heart
		A      E    B       C#m
	Cre-ate in me a work of art
		A      E    B    C#m
	Cre-ate in me a mira-cle
	A         E               B      E
	Something real, something beauti-ful

	[Repeat many times]
	
A          E                B
You're not finished with me yet
A          E                B
You're not finished with me yet
A       E           B             C#m
By Your power I can change, I can change
       A          B                E
'Cause You're not finished with me yet

[Repeat many times]
[Chorus]
