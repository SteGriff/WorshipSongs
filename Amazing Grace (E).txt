Amazing Grace - E

B7  E       E7          A         E                            B7
A - mazing grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me! 
   E        E7        A        E        C#m         B7    A     E
I once was lost, but now I'm found; Was blind, but now I see!

B7  E       E7          A         E                            B7
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved;
     E        E7        A        E      C#m    B7    A     E
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed!

B7  E       E7          A         E                      B7
Through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; 
        E        E7         A        E        C#m         B7     A     E 
It's grace that brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.

B7  E       E7             A         E                            B7
When we've been there ten thousand years, bright, shining as the sun, 
       E        E7      A        E            C#m       B       A     E
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we've first begun.
