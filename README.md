# Worship song chords

## Intro

This is a collection of worship song chords in plain text format. The advantage of plain text files is that they don't store any redundant data, so they are light and fast. These text files are meant to be opened in a text editor, ideally Notepad++ (which is a free download).

If you open plain text files in Word, the spacing will be wrong. Also, if you typeset a plain text file in a font where characters are not "fixed width" then the spacing will be wrong.  

## Fixed-width fonts

Examples include:
 * Courier
 * Courier New
 * Consolas
 * Terminal
 * DejaVu Sans Mono
 * Lucida Console
 * Fira Mono

## Tabs

The tab key is above the Caps Lock key, and it inserts a variable amount of space.
In this project, tabs are assumed to be four spaces.
