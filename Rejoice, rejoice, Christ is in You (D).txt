The world shall see that Christ is Lord!!!!........*

God is at work in us His purpose to perform,
Building a Kingdom of power not of words.
Where things impossible by faith shall be made possible,
Let's give the glory to Him now.....*

Though we are week, His grace is everything we need;
We're made of clay but this treasure is within.
He turns our weaknesses into His opportunities,
So that the glory goes to Him.....*
