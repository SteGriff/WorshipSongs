THINE BE THE GLORY - HANDEL

D					A
Thine be the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son;
D				G   D	G		  A			 D		D/C#
Endless is the vic-try, Thou o’er death hast won;
Bm				 F#m	 G					A		
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone a-way,
Bm				E			  F#m       E    A
Kept the folded grave clothes where Thy body lay.

Chorus:
Thine be the glory, risen conqu’ring Son,
Endless is the vict’ry, Thou o’er death hast won.

Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
Let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing;
For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.

[Chorus]

No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of life;
Life is naught without Thee; aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conqu’rors, through Thy deathless love:
Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.

[Chorus]
