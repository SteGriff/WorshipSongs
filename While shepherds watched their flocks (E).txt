WHILE SHEPHERDS WATCHED THEIR FLOCKS (E) 2021

      E                       A         E
While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
    E      F#     B
All seated on the ground,
    A            F#m       G#
The angel of the Lord came down,
    A      B       E
And glory  shone a-round,
 
        E                 A      E
  "Fear not," said he for mighty dread
      E            F#       B
  had seized their troubled minds
       A                F#m   G#
  Glad tidings of great joy I bring
     A       B       E
  To you and all man-kind,

   E                 A         E
To you in Da - vid's town this day
   E       F#      B
Is born of David's line
  A               F#m        G#
A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord,
     A         B      E
And this shall be the sign,

      E                  A           E
  The heaven-ly babe you there shall find
     E     F#       B
  To human view dis-played,
      A                 F#m      G#
  All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
      A    B       E
  And in a man-ger laid,

     E                  A         E
Thus spake the ser-aph, and forth-with
     E        F#      B
Ap - peared a shining throng
   A                F#m      G#
Of angels prais-ing God, who thus
    A            B       E
Add-ressed their joy-ful song,

      E           A      E 
  All glory be to God on high,
      E      F#       B
  And to the earth be peace
       A                F#m     G#
  Good will to men from highest heav'n
     A       B      E
  Be-gin and ne-ver cease!
