FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD (G)

G		   Csus2
I'm laying down my life                   This passion in my heart
              G                           This stirring in my soul
I'm giving up control                     To see the nations bow
                  Csus2                   For all the world to know
I'm never looking back                    I'm living for Your glory on the earth
            Em
I surrender all
                    Csus2        G
I'm living for Your glory on the earth

	G                   Csus2                     G

For every voice to cry out

Burn like a fire in me

You alone are the King

You are the hope of the earth
