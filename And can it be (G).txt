   C     D   G      D   A     D
An inter-est in the Sav-ior’s blood?
D                   G          D
Died He for me, who caused His pain—
    C       G            D7   G
For me, who Him to death pur-sued?
G   D      G         C   A7  D

     G        C             D       G
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

Amazing love! How can it be,
     C        G    Am       G   D7  G
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

’Tis mystery all: th’Immortal dies:   G D-G  Am7 D7 G
Who can explore His strange design?   C D G  D A D
In vain the firstborn seraph tries    D      G   D
To sound the depths of love divine.   C  G   G D7 G
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,      G D G  C A7 D
Let angel minds inquire no more.      G  C  D  G

He left His Father’s throne above     G D-G  Am7 D7 G
So free, so infinite His grace—       C D G  D A D
Emptied Himself of all but love,      D      G   D
And bled for Adam’s helpless race:    C  G   G D7 G
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,     G D G  C A7 D
For O my God, it found out me!        G  C  D  G

Long my imprisoned spirit lay,           G D-G  Am7 D7 G
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;    C D G  D A D
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray—     D      G   D
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;   C  G   G D7 G
My chains fell off, my heart was free,   G D G  C A7 D
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.   G  C  D  G

No condemnation now I dread;                G D-G  Am7 D7 G
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;             C D G  D A D
Alive in Him, my living Head,               D      G   D
And clothed in righteousness divine,        C  G   G D7 G
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,          G D G  C A7 D
And claim the crown, through Christ my own. G  C  D  G
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,          G D   D7 G
And claim the crown, through Christ my own. C  G-Am-G-D7-G
