Once in royal David's city, stood  a   lowly cattle  shed,
      B7  E      C#m   F#m7  B7 E    C#m E      A   B    E
where  a  mother laid  her   baby in  a  manger for His  bed.
A    E       Bsus4 B    E     A     E          A     B   E
Mary was that mo - ther mild, Jesus Christ her lit - tle child.


E  B7   E       B             E       C#m  E       A B     E
He came down to earth from heaven, Who is  God and Lord of all,
    B7  E       C#m F#m7 B7 E       C#m  E      A   B  E
And His shelter was  a   stable, and His cradle was a  stall;
A    E            Bsus4 B   E      A        E         A    B    E
With the poor and meek  and lowly, lived on earth our sa - vior holy.


E    B7     E       B             E        C#m   E     A   B   E
And through all His wondrous childhood, he would honor and o - bey,
     B7  E     C#m F#m7   B7 E       C#m   E      A    B  E
Love and watch the lowly mother, in whose gentle arms He lay.
A   E              Bsus4 B      E   A     E         A    B  E
Christian children  all  should be, mild, obedient, good as He.


E    B7 E        B             E            C#m E        A  B    E
And our eyes at last shall see Him, through his own re - deeming love.
     B7  E     C#m F#m7     B7    E       C#m  E       A      B   E 
For that child so  dear and gen - tle, is our  Lord in heaven a - bove;
A   E            Bsus4  B    E   A      E           A  B  E
And He leads His chil - dren on, to the place where he is gone.


E   B7 E         B     E            C#m  E    A   B    E
Not in that poor lowly stable, with the  oxen standing by,
     B7  E   C#m  F#m7   B7    E       C#m E           A    B  E 
We shall see Him, but in hea - ven, set at God's right hand on high;
A    E              Bsus4  B    E        A      E           A    B   E
When like stars His chil - dren crowned, all in white shall wait a - round.
