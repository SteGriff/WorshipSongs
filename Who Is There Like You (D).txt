Em7                  Asus      D                 G        Dm 
Even suffering in my place?      And who could repay You?

All of creation looks to You, and You provide for all You have made.

I'm trusting in Your Word, trusting in Your cross, trusting in Your blood

      G              Em             G                A               D
And all Your faithfulness, for Your power at work in me, is changing me.
