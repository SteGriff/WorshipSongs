YOU'RE A GOOD GOOD FATHER (A)

A            Asus                A         Asus         A
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
A                  Asus              A           Asus    A
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
     D                                   Bm        E 
You tell me that You're pleased and that I'm never alone

						D 
	You're a good, good father
					 A                   F#m              E 
	It's who You are,   it's who You are,   it's who You are
					 D 
	And I'm loved by You
				  A                F#m           E 
	It's who I am,   it's who I am,   it's who I am

I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide
Because You know just what we need before we say a word

[Chorus]

  D                              F#m 
  You are perfect in all of your ways 
  Bm7                            A 
  You are perfect in all of your ways 
  D                              F#m       E 
  You are perfect in all of your ways to us

A       Asus       A     Asus
Love so undeniable I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think
       D       A 
As You call me deeper still
       Bm       A 
As You call me deeper still
       D       A 
As You call me deeper still
      Bm      E 
Into love love love
