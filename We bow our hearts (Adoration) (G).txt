ADORATION (G)

Verses and Chorus:

G	D	Em	C

We bow our hearts, we lift our hands
We turn our eyes to you again
And we surrender to the truth
That all we need is found in You

	Receive our adoration
	Jesus, lamb of God
	Receive our adoration
	How wonderful you are

We choose to leave it all behind
And turn our eyes towards the prize
The upward call of God in Christ
You have our hearts, Lord take our lives

(C)	                  D     Dsus  D
	Every soul you've saved sings out
	              C       G
Everything you've made re-sounds
               D    Dsus D
All creation's stan-ding now
        C
Lifting up your name

We're joining in the angel's song
We're gathered to your ancient throne
Children in our Father's arms
Shouting out your praise
