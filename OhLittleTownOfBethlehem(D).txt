OH LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM (D)

A  D              Bm   
Oh little town of Bethlehem
    Em       A        D
How still we see thee lie
A   D             A   Bm        
A - bove the dark and dreamless sleep
    Em     A        D   
The silent stars go by
    F#m    A            D     A
Yet in thy dark streets shi - neth
    D   Em      A
The everlasting light
    D         D7       Bm                    
The hopes and fears of all the years
    G      A      D
Are met in thee tonight


A   D                 Bm  
For Christ is born of Ma - ry,
     Em       A     D
And, gathered all above,
A     D              A   Bm     
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
      Em       A         D 
Their watch of wondering love.
  F#m     A        D    A
O morning stars, toge - ther
   D         Em   A
Proclaim the holy birth,
    D       D7      Bm 
And praises sing to God the King,
    G        A      D
And peace to men on earth.


A   D             Bm                      A  D             Bm    
How silently, how silently,               Oh holy child of Bethlehem,
    Em       A       D                       Em      A     D
The wondrous gift is given;               Descend on us we pray;
A   D          A  Bm                      A    D           A   Bm    
So God imparts to human hearts            Cast out our sin and enter in
    Em        A      D                       Em      A    D 
The blessings of His Heaven.              Be born in us today.
   F#m     A        D    A                   F#m      A         D    A
No ear may hear His co - ming,            We hear the Christmas an - gels,
    D       Em       A                          D          Em      A
But in this world of sin,                 Their great glad tidings tell,
    D            D7     Bm                    D      D7   Bm 
Where meek souls will receive Him still,  Oh come to us, abide in us,
    G           A      D                      G      A     D
The dear Christ enters in.                Our lord, Eman - uel.
