OH LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM (D)

A  D              Bm    A
Oh little town of Bethlehem
    Em       A        D
How still we see thee lie
A   D             A   Bm        A
A - bove the dark and dreamless sleep
    Em     A        D   
The silent stars go by
    F#m    A            D     A
Yet in thy dark streets shi - neth
    D   A       A
The everlasting light
    D         D7       Bm                    
The hopes and fears of all the years
    G      A      D
Are met in thee tonight


A   D                 Bm   A
For Christ is born of Ma - ry,
     Em       A     D
And, gathered all above,
A     D              A   Bm     A
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
      Em       A         D 
Their watch of wondering love.
  F#m     A        D    A
O morning stars, toge - ther
   D         A    A
Proclaim the holy birth,
    D       D7      Bm 
And praises sing to God the King,
    G        A      D
And peace to men on earth.


A   D             Bm    A
How silently, how silently,
    Em       A       D
The wondrous gift is given;
A   D          A  Bm    A
So God imparts to human hearts
    Em        A      D 
The blessings of His Heaven.
   F#m     A        D    A
No ear may hear His co - ming,
    D       A        A
But in this world of sin,
    D            D7     Bm 
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
    G           A      D
The dear Christ enters in.


A  D             Bm    A
Oh holy child of Bethlehem,
   Em      A     D
Descend on us we pray;
A    D           A   Bm    A
Cast out our sin and enter in
   Em      A    D 
Be born in us today.
   F#m      A         D    A
We hear the Christmas an - gels,
      D          A       A
Their great glad tidings tell,
    D      D7   Bm 
Oh come to us, abide in us,
    G      A     D
Our lord, Eman - uel.
