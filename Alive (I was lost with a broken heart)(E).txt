I was lost with a broken heart
You picked me up, now I'm set apart
From the ash, I am born again
Forever safe in the Savior's hands

You are more than my words could say
I'll follow You, Lord, for all my days
I'll fix my eyes, follow in Your ways
Forever free in unending grace

You are, You are, You are my freedom
We lift You higher, lift You higher
Your love, Your love, Your love
Neverending

You are alive in us
Nothing can take Your place
You are all we need
Your love has set us free
