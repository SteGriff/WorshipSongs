AWAY IN A MANGER (G)

G                    Bm         Am
Away in a manger, No crib for a bed,
    C      D    G          A7             D
The little Lord Jesus, Lay down his sweet head.
    G                               Bm            Am
The stars in the bright sky, Looked down where he lay
    C      D    G       Am    C  D   G
The little Lord Jesus, Asleep on the hay.


    G                      Bm     Am
The cattle are lowing, The baby awakes;
    C      D    G          A7       D
But little Lord Jesus, No crying he makes.
  G                           Bm            Am
I love thee, Lord Jesus, Look down from the sky,
    C       D  G           Am  C    D   G
And stay by my side, until mor-ning is  nigh.


   G                     Bm          Am
Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay,
      C     D   G         A7        D
Close by me for ever, And love me I pray.
      G                         Bm         Am
Bless all the dear children, In thy tender care,
    C      D   G          Am   C    D    G
And fit us for heaven, To live with thee there.
