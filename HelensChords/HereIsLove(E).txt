HERE IS LOVE VAST AS THE OCEAN - E

A2       E                A2
Here is love, vast as the ocean
        E               B
Loving kindness as the flood
         E                   A2
When the prince of life, our ransom
         E      B/D#     E
Shed for us his precious blood

(repeat verse 1)
	 					 B/D#
	  Who his love will not remember
	 		 B7                E
	  Who can cease to sing his praise?
	 	 C#m7         A
	  He can never be forgotten
	 		 E       B/D#    E
	  Throughout heavens eternal days


	  A2     E              A2
On the mount of crucifixion
          E               B
Fountains opened deep and wide
            E                   A2
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
         E        B/D#     E
Flowed a vast and gracious tide

	 						 B/E
	  Grace and love like mighty rivers
	 					 E
	  Poured incessant from above
	 			 C#m7               A
	  And heavens peace and perfect justice
	 		 E      B/D#     E
	  Kissed a guilty world in love

(repeat chorus 1)

E                 A2
No love is higher, no love is wider
E/G#               A2
No love is deeper, no love is truer
E                 A2
No love is higher, no love is wider
E/G#                  A2
No love is like your love, O Lord
