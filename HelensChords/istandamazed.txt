I STAND AMAZED

D
I stand amazed in the presence
A      G2 D
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
G2                              D/F#   Bm
And wonder how He could love me,
G               A      D
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

D                  D/F#
How marvellous! How wonderful!
A                    A7        A7/C#
And my song shall ever be:
D                    A/C#  Bm7
How marvellous! How wonderful!
Em7    D/F#       Asus4 A   D
Is my Savior's love for me!

D
He took my sins and my sorrows,
      A             G2 D
He made them His very own;
      G2                        D/F# Bm
He bore the burden to Calvary,
        G         A    D
And suffered and died alone.

D
When with the ransomed in glory
A               G2             D
His face I at last shall see
        G2                     D/F# Bm
‘Twill be my joy through the ages
     G            A               D
To sing of his love for me.
