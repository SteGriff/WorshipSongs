I stand amazed in the presence 
of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me, 
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

  How marvelous! How wonderful! 
  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful! 
  Is my Savior’s love for me.

For me it was in the garden 
He prayed: “Not my will but Thine”,
He had no tears for his own grief, 
But sweat drops of blood for mine..

He took my sins and my sorrows, 
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry, 
And suffered, and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory 
His face I at last shall see,
‘Twill be my joy thro’ the ages 
To sing of His love for me.

Give thanks to the Lord, Our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise

With a might hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

  Forever God is faithful
  Forever God is strong
  Forever God is with us
  Forever and ever, forever [2X]

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
By the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise 
Sing praise, sing praise

Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

Father, I place into your hands
The things I cannot do,
Father, I place into your hands
The things that I've been through.
Father, I place into your hands
The way that I should go,
For I know I always can trust you. 

Father, I place into your hands
My friends and family.
Father, I place into your hands
The things that trouble me.
Father, I place into your hands
The person I would be,
For I know I always can trust you. 

Father, we love to see your face,
We love to hear your voice.

And in your name rejoice.

And in your presence rest,
For we know we always can trust you. 

Father, I want to be with you
And do the things you do.
Father, I want to speak the words
That you are speaking too.
Father, I want to love the ones
That you will draw to you,
For I know that I am one with you.

As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after you
You alone are my hearts desire
And I long to worship you

  You alone are my strengh ,my shield
  To you alone may my spirit yield
  You alone are my hearts desire
  And I long to worship you

I want you more than gold or silver
Only you can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye

You are my friend and you are my brother
Even though you are king
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything.

---------

I will offer up my life
In spirit and truth,
Pouring out the oil of love
As my worship to You
In surrender I must give my every part;
Lord, receive the sacrifice
Of a broken heart

  Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
  To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
  Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
  As a praise of Your name
  For the things You have done?
  Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
  Of the debt of love that is owed
  By this thankful heart

You deserve my every breath
For You've paid the great cost;
Giving up Your life to death,
Even death on a cross
You took all my shame away,
There defeated my sin
Opened up the gates of heaven
And have beckoned me in 

---------

I lift my eyes up, unto the moutains
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from You, maker of heaven
Creator of the earth

Oh how I need you Lord
You are my only hope
You're my only prayer
So I will wait for You
To come and rescue me
To come and give me life 

---------

Praise Him, you heavens and all thats above
Praise Him, you angels and heavenly hosts
Let the whole earth praise Him

Praise Him, the sun, moon and bright shining stars
Praise Him, you heavens and waters and skies
Let the whole earth praise Him

  Great in power, great in glory
  Great in mercy, King of Heaven
  Great in battle, great in wonder
  Great in Zion, King over all the earth
