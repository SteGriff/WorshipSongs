You Chose The Cross (G)
    
    G                              D
You chose the cross with every breath
    Em7
The perfect life, the perfect death
C                    G    D
     You chose the cross
    G                            D
A crown of thorns you wore for us
     Em7
And crowned us with eternal life
C                    G    D
     You chose the cross
    Am7                    G               D
And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain
 Am7         G            D
Obedient to death you overcame


            G
I'm lost in wonder
            Em7
I'm lost in love
            C               D
I'm lost in praise for evermore
           G                Em7
Because of Jesus' unfailing love
        C
I am forgiven
         D
I am restored


you loosed the chords of sinfulness            G  D
And broke the chains of my disgrace            Em7
You chose the cross                            C  G  D
Up from the grave victorious                   G  D
You rose again so glorious                     Em7
You choss the cross                            C  G  D
The sorrow that surrounded you was mine        Am G  D
"Yet not my will but yours be done" you cried  Am G  D
