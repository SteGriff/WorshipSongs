We're looking to Your promise of old

You will come and heal our land

You will come

You will come 
  
We're looking to the promise You made 
That if we turn and look to Your face 
You will come and heal our land 
You will come

You will come to us

Lord, send revival, start with me 
         F#m      D      A 
For I am one of unclean lips

And my eyes have seen the King

Your glory I have glimpsed

Send revival, start with me
