You Chose The Cross C (Capo 4 for E)

You chose the cross with every breath
    Am7
The perfect life, the perfect death
F                   C    G
     You chose the cross

A crown of thorns you wore for us
    Am7
And crowned us with eternal life

    Dm7                   C/E              G 
And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain
 Dm7         C/E            G
Obedient to death you overcame

I'm lost in wonder
            Am7
I'm lost in love
            F              G
I'm lost in praise for evermore
           C                Am7
Because of Jesus' unfailing love
        F
I am forgiven
         G
I am restored
