The Splendour of the King - How Great Is Our God - E

E                          C#m7
The splendour of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    A2						B
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
E                              C#m7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                    A2						B
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.


    E
    How great is our God, sing with me,
    C#m7
    How great is our God, all will see,
    A2             B               E
    How great, how great is our God.


Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,      E  C#m
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.        A  B
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,      E  C#m
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.        A  B

    E
    Name above all names,
    C#m7
    Worthy of all praise,
                   A2
    My heart will sing
         B            E
    How great is our God.
