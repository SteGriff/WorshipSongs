There Is A Day

G          Gmaj7                  Em
There is a day That all creation's waiting for, 
C              Cmaj7                      D
A day of freedom and liberation for the earth.
G            Gmaj7                    Em 
And on that day The Lord will come to meet His bride, 
C                Cmaj7                    Dsus4   D
And when we see Him In an instant we'll be changed

The trumpet sounds And the dead will then be raised 
By His power, Never to perish again. 
Once only flesh, Now clothed with immortality, 
Death has now been Swallowed up in victory

G                       D
We will meet Him in the air
                      Em 
And then we will be like Him,
            C             G     D 
For we will see Him, as He is Oh yeah!
G                          D 
Then all hurt and pain will cease
                       Em 
And we'll be with Him forever
             C           G      Dsus4   D 
And in His glory we will live Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

So lift your eyes To the things as yet unseen, 
That will remain now For all eternity. 
Though trouble's hard, It's only momentary 
And it's achieving Our future glory.
