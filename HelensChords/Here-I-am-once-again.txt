Pour Out My Heart - Craig Musseau

	   G       D
Here I am, once again
  Em                         C
I pour out my heart for I know that you hear
     G             D
Every cry, you are listening
   Em                C
No matter what state my heart is in
         G           D
You are faithful to answer
      Em                          C
With words that are true and a hope that is real
      G        D
As I feel your touch
Em                     C
You bring a freedom to all that's within

G                     D
Pour out my heart to say that I love you
Em                    C
Pour out my heart to say that I need you
G                     D
Pour out my heart to say that I'm thankful

Pour out my heart to say that you're wonderful
