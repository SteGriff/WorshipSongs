G                   C
I will offer up my life
    D          Em
In spirit and truth,
                        C
Pouring out the oil of love
        D         G
As my worship to You
G                    C       D     Em
In surrender I must give my every part;
                       C
Lord, receive the sacrifice
       D      G
Of a broken heart

                     C     D          G
  Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
                     C            D        G
  To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
                       C     D           G
  Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
                       C             D               G
  As a praise of Your name, for the things You have done?
                         Am         G      C
  Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
          Am      G            C
  Of the debt of love that is owed
      D              G           C-D
  By this thankful heart

You deserve my every breath       G C
For You've paid the great cost;   D Em
Giving up Your life to death,     Em C
Even death on a cross             D G
You took all my shame away,       G C
There defeated my sin             D Em
Opened up the gates of heaven     Em C
And have beckoned me in           D G
