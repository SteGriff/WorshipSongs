See His Love
Tim Hughes

Intro:
Em  C  D  Bm  (1 time)


Em                   D
See His love nailed onto a cross
            C                       D    
Perfect and blameless life given as sacrifice
Em                       D
See Him there all in the name of love
            C                    D
Broken yet glorious, all for the sake of us


Em            C
This is Jesus in His glory
D              Bm
King of Heaven dying for me
Em              C
It is finished, He has done it
D                Bm           Em
Death is beaten, Heaven bekons me


Em                   D
Greater love now one could ever show
         C                     D    
Mercy so undeserved, freedom I should not know
Em                    D
All my sin, all of my hidden shame
              C                      D
Died with Him on the cross, eternity won for us


Em         D/F#
Such love, such love
Bm                   C
Such love is this for me (repeat 3 times)
