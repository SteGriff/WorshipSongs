The Splendour of the King - How Great Is Our God - G

G                          Em
The splendour of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    C2						D
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
G                              Em
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                    C2						D
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.


    G
    How great is our God, sing with me,
    Em
    How great is our God, all will see,
    C2             D               G
    How great, how great is our God.


Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,      G  Em
Deginning and the end, beginning and the end.        C  D
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,      G  Em
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.        C  D

    G
    Name above all names,
    Em
    Worthy of all praise,
                   C2
    My heart will sing
         D            G
    How great is our God.
