G      G/F#     C
A sacrifice was made,
G/B                C
And then Your fire came,
Em7          G/B    C
They knelt upon the ground,
Am7          C          G
And with one voice they praised


CHORUS:
        G/B
You are good, You are good,
         C
And Your love endures
        G/B
You are good, You are good,
         C
And Your love endures
        Em7           G/B
You are good, You are good,
         C            G     C
And Your love endures today
