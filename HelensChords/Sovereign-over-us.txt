Aaron Keyes — Sovereign Over Us
Capo 2

Em                             C        Em, C, D, G
There is strength within the sorrow     You are wisdom unimagined,
D                        G              Who could understand your ways 
There is Beauty in our tears            Reigning high above the heavens,
And you meet us in our mourning         Reaching down in endless grace 
With a love that cast out fears.        
 
You are working in our waiting          You're the Lifter of the lowly, 
Sanctifying us                          Compassionate and kind 
And beyond our understanding            You surround and You uphold me, 
Your teaching us to trust               And your promises are my delight

Chorus: C, G, D, Em 

C                          G

You have not forgotten us
C                      G              D 
You're with us in the fire and the flood

You're Faithful forever

Bridge : G, C, Am, D

G                             C
Even what the enemy means for evil      Even in the valley you are faithful
                    Am                  You're working for our good
You turn it for our good                You're working for our good 
                    D                   and for your glory 
You Turn it for our good 
and for your glory
