    D
I stand amazed in the presence 
	A		 G    D
of Jesus the Nazarene,
	 G					  D	
And wonder how He could love me, 
  D	      A		     D
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

  D
 How marvelous! How wonderful! 
  A
 And my song shall ever be:
  D				Bm
 How marvelous! How wonderful! 
  G	    D        A       D
 Is my Savior’s love for me.

For me it was in the garden             D
He prayed: “Not my will but Thine”,     A G D
He had no tears for his own grief,      G D
But sweat drops of blood for mine..     D A D

He took my sins and my sorrows, 
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry, 
And suffered, and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory 
His face I at last shall see,
‘Twill be my joy thro’ the ages 
To sing of His love for me.
