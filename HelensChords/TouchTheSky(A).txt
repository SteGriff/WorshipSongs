TOUCH THE SKY - A

A/C#             D                      A/E
   What fortune lies beyond the stars;
                F#m                 A/C#
 Those dazzling heights too vast to climb;
          D                  A/E
 I got so high to fall so far
             F#m
 But I found heaven as love swept low


       A/C#                D                 A/E
          My heart beating, my soul breathing
                        F#m                 A/C#
        I found my life, when I laid it down
                       D              A/E
        Upward falling, spirit soaring
                    E
        I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

(A/C# D A/E F#m)

A/C#             D                      A/E
   What treasure waits within Your scars
              F#m                  A
 This gift of freedom gold can't buy
              D                 Esus
 I bought the world and sold my heart
            F#m                A/E
 You traded heaven to have me again


A/C#                   D
  Find me here at Your feet again
     E/A                  F#m
Everything I am, reaching out I surrender
A/C#                       D
  Come sweep me up in Your love again
       E/A					F#m
And my soul will dance, on the wings of forever
