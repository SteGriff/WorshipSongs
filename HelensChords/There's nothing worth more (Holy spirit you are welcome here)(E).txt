E                           |  E
There's nothing worth more  |  I've tasted and seen
                    A       |                     A
That will ever come close   |  Of the sweetest of loves
Nothing can compare         |  Where my heart becomes free
                  E         |                  E
You're our Living Hope      |  And my shame is undone
              A             |                A
Your Presence, Lord         |  Your Presence, Lord
