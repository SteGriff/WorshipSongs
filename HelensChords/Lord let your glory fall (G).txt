 Songs of enduring love,

 And then Your glory came
G         G/F#    C

Voices in unison,

 Giving You thanks and praise
Em7           G/B   C
 Joined by the instruments,
Am7            C     G
 And then Your glory came
G             G/F#    C
Your presence like a cloud,
G/B         C
Upon that ancient day,
Em7              G/B   C
The priests were overwhelmed,
Am7          C     G
Because Your glory came
