WHEN THE MUSIC FADES

C              G                      Dm                 G            
When the music fades, all is stripped away, and I simply come. 
C                 G                         Dm                         G
Longing just to bring, something thats of worth that will bless Your heart.
Dm             C           G                  Dm                   
I'll bring You more than a song for a song in itself 
C						G
is not what You have required,
Dm              C        G              
You search much deeper within through the way things appear 
Dm             C       G
You're looking into my heart.


C                      G                         Dm            F
I'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about You, all about 
G   C                             G                            Dm
You Jesus. I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it when it's all about 
     F         G   C
You, all about You Jesus.


King of endless worth , 
no one could express 
how much You deserve.
Though I'm weak and poor 
all I have is Yours, 
every single breath.
