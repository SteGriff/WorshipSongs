Forever Reign 

        C
You are good, You are good          You are peace, You are peace
When there's nothing good in me     When my fear is crippling
        G/B                         You are true, You are true
You are love, You are love          Even in my wandering
On display for all to see           You are joy, You are joy
        C                           You're the reason that I sing
You are light, You are light        You are life, You are life,
When the darkness closes in         In You death has lost it's sting
        G/B
You are hope, You are hope          You are more, You are more
                           C        Than my words will ever say
You have covered all my sin         You are Lord, You are Lord
                                    All creation will proclaim
Chorus:                             You are here, You are here
C                       G/C         In your presence I'm made whole           
Oh, I’m running to Your arms,       You are God, You are God
                    Am              Of all else I'm letting go
I’m running to Your arms
                   G/A
The riches of Your love
     G           F
Will always be e-nough
            Am       G       F
Nothing com-pares to Your em-brace
             Am         G    F (C) 
Light of the world, for-ever reign

Bridge:

  My heart will sing,

  No other name
