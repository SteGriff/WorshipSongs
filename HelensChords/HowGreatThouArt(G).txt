How Great Thou Art (G)

G                       C
O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder 

         G        D 		        G
Consider all the works thy hand has made 

                            C
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder 

                    G        D              G
Your power through- out the uni- verse dis- played 


                    G        C              G
      Then sings my soul, my saviour God to thee 
      
                     D                   G
      How great thou art, how great thou art 
      
                    G        C              G
      Then sings my soul, my saviour God to thee 
      
                     D        C     D    G
      How great thou art, how great thou art 


When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,  G C
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.        G D G
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur       C
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.       G D G


And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;     G C
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;            G D G
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,         C
He bled and died to take away my sin.                G D G


When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,   G C
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.      G D G
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,               C
And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"     G D G
