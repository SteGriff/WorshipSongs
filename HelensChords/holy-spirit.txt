Holy Spirit - Bryan and Katie Torwalt

A                               | A
there's nothing worth more      | I've tasted and seen
                     D          |                    D
that will ever come close       | of the sweetest of love
no thing can compare            | were my heart becomes free
                   A            |                    A
you're our living hope          | and my shame is undone
          D                     |                   D
your presence                   | your presence Lord
                                 
     A
