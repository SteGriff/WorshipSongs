Set a fire - C

C                           F
 Set a Fire Down in my Soul
                                         Am
 That I cant contain that I cant control
                       F
I want more of you God  I want more of you God

C
  No Place I'd rather be
F
  No Place I'd rather be
Am
  No place I'd rather be
F
 Here in your Love, Here in your love
