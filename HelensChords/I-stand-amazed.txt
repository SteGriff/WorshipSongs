I stand amazed in the presence

G
I stand amazed in the presence
D                 G
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
C      Am           G
And wonder how He could love me,
G          D         G
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

Chorus
G
How marvelous! How wonderful!
D
And my song shall ever be,
G              Em
How marvelous! How wonderful!
Am    G        C    D   G
Is my Savior·s love for me!

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calbary,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.
