See His love nailed onto a cross
            D                       E    
Perfect and blameless life given as sacrifice
F#m                       E
See Him there all in the name of love
            D                    E
Broken yet glorious, all for the sake of us

This is Jesus in His glory

King of Heaven dying for me
F#m              D
It is finished, He has done it
E                C#m          F#m
Death is beaten, Heaven bekons me


F#m                   E
Greater love now one could ever show
         D                     E    
Mercy so undeserved, freedom I should not know
F#m                    E
All my sin, all of my hidden shame
              D                      E
Died with Him on the cross, eternity won for us

Such love, such love

Such love is this for me (repeat 3 times)
