You Chose The Cross (E)
    
    E                    B/D#
You chose the cross with every breath
    C#m7
The perfect life, the perfect death
A            E    B
     You chose the cross
  E                        B/D#
A crown of thorns you wore for us
    C#m7
And crowned us with eternal life
A               E    B
     You chose the cross
    F#m7            E/G#         B
And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain
 F#m7    E/G#    B
Obedient to death you overcame


            E
I'm lost in wonder
            C#m7
I'm lost in love
            A               B
I'm lost in praise for evermore
           E                C#m7
Because of Jesus' unfailing love
        A
I am forgiven
         B
I am restored


you loosed the chords of sinfulness
And broke the chains of my disgrace
You chose the cross
Up from the grave victorious
You rose again so glorious
You choss the cross
The sorrow that surrounded you was mine
"Yet not my will but yours be done" you cried

	   	 B	   E			   A
No I'll never know how much it cost
	B	   E			  A     (B)
To see my sin upon that cross
