OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA
E  F#m  A  B

E					 		  F#m			   
Over the mountains and the sea, your river runs with love for me,
A					  B
And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth, and I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing of when your love came down

	E                    F#m		
	I could sing of Your love forever
	A                    B
	I could sing of Your love forever

F#m	E/F#	A	B		x2
Oh I feel like praising, giving glory all to You 
And when the world has seen this light
They will catch the fire and they'll praise you too
