WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS (E)

		  E   A            E
When I survey the wondrous cross
             C#m   A         B
on which the Prince of Glory died;
           E   A            C#m    A
my richest gain I count but loss,
            E    A    B     E
and pour contempt on all my pride.

		    E   A              E
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
            C#m  A              B
save in the death of Christ, my God;
              E    A              C#m    A
all the vain things that charm me most,
       E   A     B       E
I sacrifice them to his blood.

		       E   A               E
See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
           C#m A             B
sorrow and love flow mingled down.
               E  A            C#m    A
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
            E    A    B     E
or thorns compose so rich a crown.

		        E   A           E
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
            C#m  A               B
that were an o - ffering far too small;
         E    A          C#m    A
love so ama - zing, so divine,
            E   A    B       E
demands my soul, my life, my all.
