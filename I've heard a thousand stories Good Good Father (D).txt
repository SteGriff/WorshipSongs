YOU'RE A GOOD GOOD FATHER (D)

D                                  D
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
D                                        D
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
    G       D                          Em7        A
You tell me that Your pleased and that I'm never alone

							G
	You're a good, good father
					D                     Em7            A
	It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
						G
	And I'm loved by you
					D               Em7            A
	It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
D                                   D
But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide
             G        D                  Em 		A
Because You know just what we need before we say a word


	G                              Bm
	You are perfect in all of your ways 
	Em7                            D
	You are perfect in all of your ways 
	G                              Bm       A
	You are perfect in all of your ways to us


D                              D
Love so undeniable I can hardly speak
D                              D
Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think
           G       D/C#
As You call me deeper still
           Em7     D/C#
As You call me deeper still
           G       D/C#
As You call me deeper still
      Em7      A
Into love love love
