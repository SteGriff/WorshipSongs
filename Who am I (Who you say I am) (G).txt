WHO YOU SAY I AM (G)

G
Who am I that the highest King
      Em  D    G
Would wel-come me
G
I was lost but He brought me in
       Em   D   C
Oh His love for me
       Em   D   C
Oh His love for me

            G  
	Who the Son sets free
	      D
	Oh is free indeed
	      Em    D  C
	I'm a child of God
	      G
	Yes I am
	      G
	In my Father's house
	          D
	There's a place for me
	      Em    D  C
	I'm a child of God
	      G
	Yes I am
	
G
Free at last He has ransomed me
       Em    D    G
Oh His grace runs deep
G
While I was a slave to sin
      Em   D   G
Jesus died for me
       Em   D   G
Yes He died for me

         Em          D
	I am chosen, not forsaken
	  G                   C
	I am who You say I am
	        Em           D
	You are for me, not against me
	  G                   C
	I am who You say I am
