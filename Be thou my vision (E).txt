Be Thou my Vision - E

E
Be Thou my vision, O lord of my heart; 
B						  A				 B
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art;
A			  E				 C#m		 A    B
Thou my best thought, in the day and the night,
E           C#m           A      B    E
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. 

Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word;          E
I ever with Thee, and Thou with me Lord;          B      A   B
Thou my Great Father, and I Thy true son;         A  E   C#m A-B
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one.          E  C#m A   B-E

Be Thou my breast-plate, my sword for the fight;  E
Be Thou my armour, and be Thou my might.          B      A   B
Thou my soul's shelter, and Thou my high tower:   A  E   C#m A-B
Raise Thou me Heavenward, O power of my power.    E  C#m A   B-E

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,        E
Thou mine inheritance, through all my days:       B      A   B
Thou and Thou only, the first in my heart,        A  E   C#m A-B
High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art.        E  C#m A   B-E

High King of Heaven when the battle is done,      E
Grant Heaven's joy to me, bright heaven's sun!    B      A   B
Christ of my own heart, whatever befall,          A  E   C#m A-B
Still be thou my vision, O Ruler of all.          E  C#m A   B-E
