Song: Forever Reign

        A
You are good, You are good
When there's nothing good in me
        E/G#
You are love, You are love
On display for all to see
        A
You are light, You are light
When the darkness closes in
        E/G#
You are hope, You are hope
                           A
You have covered all my sin

VERSE 2									VERSE 3
You are peace, You are peace      		You are more, You are more
When my fear is crippling         		Than my words will ever say
You are true, You are true        		You are Lord, You are Lord
Even in my wandering              		All creation will proclaim
You are joy, You are joy          		You are here, You are here
You're the reason that I sing     		In your presence I'm made whole
You are life, You are life,       		You are God, You are God
In You death has lost it's sting  		Of all else I'm letting go

A                       E/A                    
	I’m running to Your arms,
                    F#m
I’m running to Your arms
                   E/F#
The riches of Your love
     E           D
Will always be e-nough
            F#m       E       D
Nothing com-pares to Your em-brace
             F#m         E    [D (A ON REPEAT)]
Light of the world, for-ever reign

 Jesus  Je-sus
