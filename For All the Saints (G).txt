Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their might;  For Martyrs, who with rapture kindled eye,
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well fought fight;    Saw the bright crown descending from the sky,
Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true light.     And seeing, grasped it, Thee we glorify.
Alleluia, Alleluia!                                    Alleluia, Alleluia!
                                                       
For the Apostles' glorious company,                    O blest communion, fellowship divine!
Who bearing forth the Cross o'er land and sea,         We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
Shook all the mighty world, we sing to Thee:           All are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
Alleluia, Alleluia!                                    Alleluia, Alleluia!
                                                       
For the Evangelists, by whose blest word,              O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
Like fourfold streams, the garden of the Lord,         Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
Is fair and fruitful, be Thy Name adored.              And win with them the victor's crown of gold.
Alleluia, Alleluia!                                    Alleluia, Alleluia!

And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,       But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,            The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
And hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong.      The King of glory passes on His way.
Alleluia, Alleluia!                                    Alleluia, Alleluia!
                                                       
The golden evening brightens in the west;              From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;      Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
Sweet is the calm of paradise the blessed.             And singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost:
Alleluia, Alleluia!                                    Alleluia, Alleluia!
