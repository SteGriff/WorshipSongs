While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
C2  C      D      G      G/F
All seated on the ground,
    F        C   G         Em
The angel of the Lord came down,

And glo-ry  shone a - round,

"Fear not," said he (for  mighty dread
C2  C            D        G
had seized their troubled mind);

And this shall be the sign,

"The heaven-ly babe you  there shall find
C2 C     D        G
To human view dis-played,

All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,

And in a   man-ger laid,

Add-ressed their joy-ful song,
