ONCE IN ROYAL DAVID'S CITY (C)

C    G  C     Dm      G  C   C      Am  Em    F   G   C
Once in royal David's ci-ty, stood  a   lowly cat-tle shed,
      G  C      Am    Dm   G  C   C   Am  Em     F   G    C
where a  mother laid  her  ba-by  in  a   manger for His  bed.
F    C        G      C     F     C          F     G   C
Mary was that mother mild, Jesus Christ her lit - tle child.


C  G    C       Dm         G  C    C   Am  Em      F    G  C
He came down to earth from heaven, Who is  God and Lord of all,
    G   C       Am   Dm  G  C    C   Am   Em     F   G  C
And His shelter was  a   stable, and His  cradle was a  stall;
F        C        G        C      F        C         F    G    C
With the poor and meek and lowly, lived on earth our sa - vior holy.

		 G   C         Am    Dm7  G    C   C  Am    Em     F    G  C
	Love and watch the low - ly   mai-den, in whose gentle arms He lay.

     G   C        Am   Dm   G     C    C   Am  Em      F      G   C

F      C         G        C   F      C           F  G  C
And He leads His children on, to the place where he is gone.


C   G   C        Dm    G   C    C    Am  Em   F    G    C
Not in that poor lowly sta ble, with the oxen stan-ding by,
     G   C        Am  Dm   G     C    C   Am  Em          F    G  C 
We shall see Him, but in   hea - ven, set at  God's right hand on high;
F         C         G        C        F      C           F    G   C       C
When like stars His children crowned, all in white shall wait a - round.

	When like stars His children crowned, all in white shall wait a - round.
