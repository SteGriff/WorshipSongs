ASK, SEEK, KNOCK - G Capo 2 (A) - Album Key

C  G  D  Em  C  G  D

               C    G
I'm reading my  B I B L E
    D               Em
And this is what it says to me
   C                 G          D
It tells me that I'm never ever alone
                C     G 
I'm learning how  J E S U S
     D              Em
Came down to us and gave his best
    C                    G                  D
Without a doubt the best friend you'll ever know

  C         D        Em           C                  D
    Our God knows ex-actly what I need so I remember this (let's go!)


             C      G
    When you ask he cares, 
             D         Em 
    When you seek he's there, 
             C                       G
    When you knock knock knock knock knock, 
        D         
    God opens up the door
