IT'S RISING UP (G)

      G
It's rising up from coast to coast,
                         Em7     D
from north to south, and east to west;
    G
the cry of hearts that love your name,
                        Em7       D      G
which with one voice we will proclaim.

     G
The former things have taken place,
                    Em7      D
can this be the new day of praise?
   G
A heav'nly song that comes to birth,
                   Em7      D
and reaches out to all the earth.

    Am7            Bm7
Oh, let the cry to nations ring,
     C                D
that all may come and all may sing:

 G    C      G
"Holy is the Lord."
 Em7  C      D
"Holy is the Lord."

    G
And we have heard the Lion's roar,
                        Em7       D
that speaks of heaven's love and power.
    G
Is this the time, is this the call
                    Em7      D
that ushers in Your kingdom rule?

    Am7            Bm7
Oh, let the cry to nations ring,
     C                D
that all may come and all may sing:

 G     C    G
"Jesus is alive!"
 Em7   C    D
"Jesus is alive!"
