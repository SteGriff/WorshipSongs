Arms of Love

E          B             C#m
I sing a simple song of love
        A   C#m         B
to my Savior, to my Jesus.
E             B                      C#m
I'm grateful for the things you've done,
            A   C#m              B
my loving Savior, my precious Jesus.

F#m           C#m
My heart is glad
              B             E
that you've called me your own
F#m          C#m              B
There's no place I'd rather be
             E G#m7     A
than in your arms of love,
        E G#m7    A
in your arms of love,
             C#m
Holding me still,
G#m7         A
holding me near
                 E
in your arms of love.
