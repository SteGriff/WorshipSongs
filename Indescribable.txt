Artist: Chris Tomlin
Song: Indescribable

Em                                 D             G
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Am              Am7/G           F
Creation's revealing Your majesty
Em                              D            G    
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
Am                           Am7/G           F
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
C2
All exclaiming


G              D
Indescribable, uncontainable,
C2                                                  Em
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                   C2
You are amazing God
G            D
All powerful, untameable,
C2                                             Em
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
                 C2
You are amazing God


Em                                D               G
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Am                    Am7/G                 F
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Em                              D            G    
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Am                        Am7/G                 F
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
              C2 
None can fathom


G              D
Indescribable, uncontainable,
C2                                                  Em
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                   C2
You are amazing God
G            D
All powerful, untameable,
C2                                             Em
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
                 C2
You are amazing God


G              D
Incomparable, unchangeable
C2                                                  Em
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
                  C2
You are amazing God
                  C2
You are amazing God
