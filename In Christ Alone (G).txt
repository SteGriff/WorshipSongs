IN CHRIST ALONE - G

   C       G       C        D
In Christ alone my hope is found,
G/B      C           D          G     
He is my light, my strength, my song;
     C     G           C       D  
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
G/B               C        D          G
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
     G/B        C         G/B       D
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
     G/B       C             G/B      D
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
   C     G       C      D
My Comforter, my All in All,
G/B         C        D        G
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! Who took on flesh        C   G  C   D
Fulness of God in helpless babe!          G/B C  D   G
This gift of love and righteousness       C   G  C   D 
Scorned by the ones he came to save:      G/B C  D   G  
Till on that cross as Jesus died,         G/B C  G/B D
The wrath of God was satisfied            G/B C  G/B D 
For every sin on Him was laid;            C   G  C   D
Here in the death of Christ I live.       G/B C  D   G
            
There in the ground His body lay          C   G  C   D
Light of the world by darkness slain:     G/B C  D   G
Then bursting forth in glorious Day       C   G  C   D 
Up from the grave he rose again!          G/B C  D   G 
And as He stands in victory               G/B C  G/B D
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,      G/B C  G/B D          
For I am His and He is mine               C   G  C   D
Bought with the precious blood of Christ. G/B C  D   G

No guilt in life, no fear in death,       C   G  C   D
This is the power of Christ in me;        G/B C  D   G
From life's first cry to final breath.    C   G  C   D 
Jesus commands my destiny.                G/B C  D   G 
No power of hell, no scheme of man,       G/B C  G/B D
Can ever pluck me from His hand;          G/B C  G/B D 
Till He returns or calls me home,         C   G  C   D
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.   G/B C  D   G
