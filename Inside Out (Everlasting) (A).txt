Inside Out
Hillsong	(A)

Verse 1
          D
A thousand times I've failed
          A     E
Still Your mercy remains
           D
And should I stumble again
            A             E
Still I'm caught in Your grace
    F#m
Everlasting
     D                A         E
Your light will shine when all else fades
       F#m
Never-ending
     D              A      E
Your glory goes beyond all fame

(Repeat Intro)

            D
Your will above all else
    A            E
My purpose remains

The art of losing myself

In bringing You praise

D                    A
In my heart in my soul
              F#m
I give You control
                             E
Consume me from the inside out Lord
D                  F#m
Let justice and praise

Become my embrace

And the cry of my heart

Is to bring You praise

From the inside out
         D           E
Lord my soul cries out
