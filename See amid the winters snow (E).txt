SEE AMID THE WINTER'S SNOW (E)
(verses 1, 2, 5, 6)

E     F#m G#m A        E
See a-mid the winter's snow,
E        A     F#m     B
Born for us on earth below,
E        F#m  G#m A      E
See, the Lamb of  God appears,
C#m      A    B       E
Promised from eternal years.

  E         A    F#m     B
	Hail thou ever blessèd morn,
  E         A       F#m   B
	Hail redemption's happy dawn,
	C#m              A    E
	Sing through all Jeru-salem:
	E         F#m     B      E
	Christ is born in Bethle-hem.

E     F#m  G#m A      E
Lo, within a   manger lies
E      A         F#m    B
He Who built the starry skies;
E       F#m     G#m A      E
He Who, thronèd in  height sublime,
C#m     A      B     E
Sits a-mid the cheru-bim.

C#m            A      G#m
Sacred Infant, all di-vine,
F#m           B        Cdim   {x 3 4 5 4 x}
What a tender love was Thine,
C#m               A       E
Thus to come from highest bliss
E       A      B        E
Down to such a world as this.

E        F#m   G#m A    E
Teach, O teach us, holy Child,
E       A      F#m      B
By Thy face so meek and mild,
E        F#m G#m  A      E
Teach us to  re - semble Thee,
C#m    A     B      E
In Thy sweet humili-ty.
