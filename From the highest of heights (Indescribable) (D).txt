From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Em              Em7/D             C
Creation's revealing Your majesty
Bm                              Asus/C#      D      D2
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
Em                           Em7/D           C
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
G2
All exclaiming

    D                    Dsus
    Indescribable, uncontainable,
    G2                                              Bm
    You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                       G2
    You are amazing God
    D  D2           Dsus
    All powerful, untameable,

    You are amazing God

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Em                    Em7/D                 C
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Bm                              Asus/C#         D     D2
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Em                        Em7/D                 C
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
              G2 
None can fathom

    D                    Dsus
    Incomparable, unchangeable
    G2                                                  Bm
    You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
                      G2
    You are amazing God
                      G2
    You are amazing God
