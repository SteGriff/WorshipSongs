    Indescribable, uncontainable,

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Em                    Em7/D                 C
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Bm                              Asus/C#         D     D2
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Em                        Em7/D                 C
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
