FOREVER (A)

A                        E/G#
 The moon and stars they wept
                    F#m
The morning sun was dead
                   D
The Saviour of the world was fallen
A                E/G#
 His body on the cross
                         F#m
His blood poured out for us
                    D
The weight of every curse upon him

[E/A A,   E/G#,  E/F F#m,   D]

A                    E/G#
 One final breath he gave
                 F#m
As heaven looked away
                   D 
The son of God was laid in darkness
A                E/G#
 A battle in the grave
                     F#m
The war on death was waged
                     D
The power of hell forever broken

 A                    E
  The ground began to shake
                      F#m
 The stone was rolled away
                        D
 his perfect love could not be overcome
 A/C#                     E
  Now death where is your sting?
                 F#m
 Our resurrected King
                    D
 Has rendered you defeated

	A E F#m D
	Forever he is glorified
	Forever he is lifted high
	Forever he is risen
	He is alive, He is alive!

A E F#m D
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
The Lamb has overcome
