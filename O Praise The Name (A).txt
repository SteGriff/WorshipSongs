O Praise The Name (A)

         A
I cast my mind to Calvary
            E             F#m
Where Jesus bled and died for me
          D                    A/C#
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
          E           A        C#m  D
My Saviour on that cursed tree

         A                          
His body bound and drenched in tears
              E              F#m
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
             D             A/C#
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
       E               A     C#m  D
Messiah still and all alone

	  A                      D        A
	O Praise the Name of the Lord our God
	  F#m                 Esus4  E        
	O Praise His Name forever - more
		A/C#                   D         F#m         
	For endless days, we will sing Your praise
	   D        Esus4 E   A      C#m   D
	Oh Lord, oh Lord  our God

           A                      
Then on the third, at break of dawn
           E          F#m
The Son of heaven rose again
           D                 A/C#          
O trampled death, where is your sting
          E                   A     
The angels roar for Christ the King

	  A               A/C#    D        A
	O Praise the Name of the Lord our God
	  F#m                 Esus4  E        
	O Praise His Name forever - more
		A/C#                   D         F#m         
	For endless days, we will sing Your praise
	   D        Esus4 E   A     
	Oh Lord, oh Lord  our God

           A
He shall return in robes of white
            E                 F#m
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
           D            A/C#
And I will rise among the saints
           E                A
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
