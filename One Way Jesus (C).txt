ONE WAY (C)

C
I lay my life down at your feet
Am
You're the only one I need
G                                 F
I turn to you, and you are always there

In troubled times it's You I seek
I put you first, that's all I need
I humble all I am, all to You!

	C         G
	One Way - Jesus
	Am                       F
	You're the only one that I could live for
	C         G
	One Way - Jesus
	Am                       Bb
	You're the only one that I could live for

C
You are always, always there
Am
Every how and everywhere
G                                   F
Your grace abounds so deeply within me

You will never ever change,
Yesterday, today the same
Forever 'til forever meets no end

(Chorus)

    C                   G
	You are the way the truth and the life
	   Am                Bb               Am
	We live by faith and not by sight for you
	      G              F    (Bb)
	We're living all for You
