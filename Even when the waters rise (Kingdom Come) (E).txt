KINGDOM COME
BETH CROFT

	 C#m					A
Even when the waters rise            Standing in Your victory
		C#m						 A   Calling on the name of Jesus
And the waves are crashing over      We wont stop until we see
		   C#m                       The lame rise to their feet
We're hard pressed on every side     Surely You have overcome
    A					    C#m
But won't give up the fight
                       B
Surely You are holding on

CHORUS 1							 CHORUS 2
C#m					A                Instead, play:
	Father let Your kingdom come     E  A  C#m  B
     E               B
Your will be done on earth
Saviour can You hear us call
We trust You are enough

C#m               A 
To be thrown into flames and still to say
E
My God He saves
B/Eb
My God He saves
C#m                  A
To see suffering and pain and still to say
E             B
My God He rei-gns

To CHORUS then CHORUS 2
