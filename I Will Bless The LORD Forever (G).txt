I WILL BLESS THE LORD FOREVER

C                     G
I will bless the Lord forever
I will trust Him at all times
He has delivered me from all fear
He has set my feet upon a rock
C                   C/B
I will not be moved
    Am              D
And I'll say of the Lord

	           G          Am
	You are my shield, my strength
	   C          D
	My portion, deliverer
		G              Am
	My shelter strong tower
		C           D               C
	My very present help in time of need

C                     G
Whom have I in heaven but you
There is none I desire beside you
C                    C/B
You have made me glad
    Am              D
And I'll say of the Lord
