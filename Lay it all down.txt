C                   D       Em   | C                       D      Em
Bring your worry, grief and pain | When we’ve given up on better days
                         Am      |                              Am
Every cause you have for shame   | There are memories we can’t erase
                  C              |                  C
Lay it all down, lay it all down | Lay it all down, lay it all down
C                      D      Em | C                           D     Em
When your cares have buried you  | We’ve come to fear what we can’t explain
                            Am   |                                         Am
And there’s nothing left to do   | There’s nothing here that can ease the pain
                 C               |                  C
Lay it all down lay it all down  | Lay it all down, lay it all down

 Carried on but your heart was tired
                                Am
 Feared the worst and felt the fire
