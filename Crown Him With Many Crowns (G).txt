CROWN HIM WITH MANY CROWNS (Capo 4 - B)

G               Em    C               
Crown Him with many crowns          
     G    C         D7                
The Lamb upon His throne              
      G         Em      A      D       
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns   
      D   Esus      D                 
All music but  its own                
  G                  C                
Awake, my soul, and sing              
    A                D                
Of Him who died for thee              
     G       C         D7      G         
And hail Him as thy matchless King    
         C      D7         G          
Through all e - ter – ni - ty         

G              Em      C                
Crown Him the Lord of life           
        G      C        D7             
Who triumphed o’er the grave           
      G     Em      A        D         
And rose victorious in the strife      
      D      Esus     D                
For those He came to save              
       G            C                  
His glories now we sing                
     A                D                
Who died and rose on high              
     G      C     D7       G           
Who died eternal life to bring         
      C         D7        G            
And lives that death may die           

 G              Em      C            
Crown Him the Lord of love
  G          C        D7
Behold His hands and side
        G         Em   A    D       
Those wounds yet visi-ble above 
     D    Esus   D
In beauty glori-fied
     G           C  
No angel in the sky
      A              D
Can fully bear that sight,
      G       C         D7      G  
But downward bends His burning eye
    C   D7   G
At mysteries so bright.







 G             Em      C               
Crown Him the Lord of peace
        G       C      D7
Whose power a scepter sways
      G       Em         A         D    
From pole to pole, that wars may cease
     D     Esus         D
And all be prayer and praise
      G                  C  
His reign shall know no end
      A                D
And round His pierced feet
        G        C    D7    G           
Fair flowers of para-dise extend    
         C       D7    G
Their fragrance ever sweet.

 
  G            Em      C   
Crown Him the Lord of years,
G        C        D7
The Potentate of time,
G       Em      A       D   
Creator of the rolling spheres,
  D  Esus   D
Ineffably sublime!
     G              C  
All hail Redeemer, hail
      A                D
For Thou hast died for me
     G          C    D7        G  
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
         C   D7   G
Through-out eter-nity
