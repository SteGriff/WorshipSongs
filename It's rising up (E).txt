IT'S RISING UP (E)

E
It's rising up from coast to coast,
                         C#m7    B
from north to south, and east to west;
    E
the cry of hearts that love your name,
                        C#m7      B      E
which with one voice we will proclaim.

     E
The former things have taken place,
                    C#m7     B
can this be the new day of praise?
   E
A heav'nly song that comes to birth,
                   C#m7     B
and reaches out to all the earth.

    F#m7           Abm7
Oh, let the cry to nations ring,
     A                B
that all may come and all may sing:

	 E    A      E
	"Holy is the Lord."
	 C#m7 A      B
	"Holy is the Lord."

    E
And we have heard the Lion's roar,
                        C#m7      B
that speaks of heaven's love and power.
    E
Is this the time, is this the call
                    C#m7     B
that ushers in Your kingdom rule?

    F#m7           Abm7
Oh, let the cry to nations ring,
     A                B
that all may come and all may sing:

	 E     A    E
	"Jesus is alive!"
	 C#m7  A    B
	"Jesus is alive!"
