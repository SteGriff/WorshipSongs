A deep damage in the people

But pride stops us

Stretching out our withered hand

But God has stretched out to heal us

This I know this I know

There's a great darkness over this land
A deep darkness on the people
But a light is shining
That the dark can't understand
The Light of the world King Jesus
Do you know do you know
Do you know do you know
