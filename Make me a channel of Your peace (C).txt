Make me a channel of your peace,
      C               Cmaj7             Dm       G7
Where there is hatred let me bring your love
      Dm           G7             Dm     G7
Where there is injury your pardon Lord
     Dm                       G7      C   C7
And where there's doubt true faith in you.

	O Master grant that I may never seek
	   G                            C   C7
	So much to be consoled as to console
		  F                      C
	to be understood as to understand
			D7                         G7
	to be loved as to love with all my soul.

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope
Where there is darkness, only light
And where there's sadness, ever joy.

Make me a channel of your peace,
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
In giving to all that we recieve
And in dying that we're born to eternal life
