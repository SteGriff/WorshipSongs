WE WANT TO SEE JESUS LIFTED HIGH

A                 E             F#m
We want to see jesus lifted high
                D                     A
A banner that flies across this land
                    E                     F#m
Then all men might see the truth and know
            D
He is the way to heaven

Chorus:
A
We want to see
E
We want to see
F#m             D
We want to see Jesus lifted high

Bridge:
A        E                   F#m
Step by step we're moving foward
              E                F#m
Little by little taking ground
        E                      F#m
Every prayer, a powerful weapon
             D              E
Strongholds come tumblin' down and down and down and down
