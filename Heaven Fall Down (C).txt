Heaven Fall Down
Phil Wickham

C
Open our eyes, Lord let us see
                                    Am F
All that You are, all that You mean
C
Open our ears, Lord let us hear
                                    Am F
All that You are, be loud and clear
            C
Please be near

Pre:
        F
As our praises rise, 
           G
May Your presence fall!

Chorus:
C              Am        F
Heaven, Heaven fall down!
C              Am       G
Spirit, Spirit pour out!
       F               C
On us all now, Heaven fall down

Come, Jesus, come
Come like the wind
Fill up this place we welcome you in
Come, Jesus, come
Come like the rain
Open the sky, show us your face
Oh, Lord we wait

F
We're crying out in desperation,
G
Waiting now in expectation,
Am 							G
Crying out in desperation, For You

C              Am        F
Heaven, Heaven fall down!
C              Am       F
Spirit, Spirit pour out!
C              Am        F
Heaven, Heaven fall down!
C              Am       G
Spirit, Spirit pour out!
       F               C
On us all now, Heaven fall down
