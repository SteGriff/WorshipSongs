O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM (D)

A  D      F#m     Bm     Bm/A
Oh little town of Bethle-hem
    Em       A        D
How still we see thee lie
A   D        F#m      Bm        Bm/A
A - bove thy deep and dreamless sleep
    Em     A        D   
The silent stars go by
    F#m    A            D     A
Yet in thy dark streets shi - neth
    D   Em      A      A7
The everlasting light
    D                  Bm      Bm/A        
The hopes and fears of all the years
    G      A      D
Are met in thee tonight

  A   D         F#m     Bm   Bm/A
  For Christ is born of Ma - ry,
       Em       A    D
  And, gathered all above,
  A     D       F#m        Bm     Bm/A
  While mortals sleep, the angels keep
        Em       A         D 
  Their watch of wondering love.
     F#m     A        D   A
  O  morning stars, toge -ther
     D         Em   A       A7
  Proclaim the holy birth,
      D               Bm      Bm/A
  And praises sing to God the King,
      G        A      D
  And peace to men on earth.

A   D              Bm                      A  D    F#m      Bm     Bm/A
How silent-ly, how silent-ly,              Oh holy child of Bethle-hem,
    Em       A       D                        Em      A     D     A
The wondrous gift is given;                Descend to us we pray;
A   D             Bm                       A    D       F#m     Bm    Bm/A
So God imparts to human hearts             Cast out our sin and enter in
    Em        A      D                        Em      A    D 
The blessings of His Heaven.               Be born in us today.
   F#m     A        D    A                    F#m      A         D    A
No ear may hear His co - ming,             We hear the Christmas an - gels,
    D       Em       A     A7                    D          Em      A    
But in this world of sin,                  Their great glad tidings tell,
      D                 Bm        Bm/A        D           Bm       Bm/A
Where meek souls will receive Him still,   Oh come to us, abide in us,
    G           A      D    (A)                G      A     D
The dear Christ enters in.                 Our Lord, Eman - uel.
