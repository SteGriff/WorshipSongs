CREATE IN ME (A) - A bit high

		D      A    E            F#m
	Cre-ate in me a clean, clean heart
		D      A    E       F#m
	Cre-ate in me a work of art
		D      A    E    F#m
	Cre-ate in me a mira-cle
	D         A               F#m    E    A
	Something real, something beau - ti - ful

	[Repeat many times]
	
D          A                E
You're not finished with me yet
D          A                E
You're not finished with me yet
D       A           E             F#m
By Your power I can change, I can change
       D          E                A
'Cause You're not finished with me yet

[Repeat many times]
[Chorus]
