Song: One Thing Remains

Verse 1:
E                   B              F#
Higher than the mountains that I face
E                   B           F#
Stronger than the power of the grave
E                B              F#
Constant in the trial and the change
E         B  F#
One thing… Remains (repeat)

Chorus:
G#m                       E
Your love never fails, never gives up
 B                F#
Never runs out on me (3x)

Verse 2:

On and on and on and on it goes

It overwhelms and satisfies my soul

And I never, ever, have to be afraid

One thing remains

Bridge:
    E         B        F#
In death, In life, I’m confident and
C#maj7           E        B          F#
covered by the power of Your great love
  E        B       F#
My debt is paid, there’s nothing that can
C#maj7        E          B          F#
separate my heart from Your great love
