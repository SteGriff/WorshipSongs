NO NOT BY MIGHT

D
No not by might nor even power
D                    G
But by Your Spirit O Lord
G                D
Healer of hearts binder of wounds
G              A       D
Lives that are lost restored
G
Flow through this land
D              G           A         D
Til every man praises Your Name once more
