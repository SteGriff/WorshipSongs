I WANT TO SCREAM IT OUT (E)

E
I want to scream it out from every mountain top
A
Your goodness knows no bounds, Your goodness never stops
C#m
Your mercy follows me, Your kindness fills my life
A                B                            
Your love amazes me

		     E
	And I'll sing because You are good
	And I'll dance because You are good
	         A
	And I'll shout because You are good
	You are good to me

E   A   C#m   A B
Nothing and no one comes anywhere close to You
The earth and ocean deep only reflect this truth
And in my darkest night You shine as bright as day
Your love amazes me

 BRIDGE
 A               C#m                     A                                 
 And in a cry of praise my heart will proclaim 
          E             B
 You are good, You are good
         C#m                      A
 in the summer rain my heart celebrates
         E              B
 You are good, You are good
