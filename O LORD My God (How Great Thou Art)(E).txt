HOW GREAT THOU ART

E                        A
O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder
A        E       B                   E
Consider all the works thy hand hath made,
E                           A
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
A                 E       B            E       B           
Thy power through-out the universe dis-played;

				  E        A               E
	Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
				   B    A                E     B
	How great Thou art,   how great Thou art!
				  E        A               E     C#m
	Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
				   F#m       A     B    E
	How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wander   E  A
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;       A E B E
when I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,      E  A
and hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;     A E B E  B

And when I think that God his son not sparing,      E  A
Sent him to die - I scarce can take it in,          A E B E
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing,         E  A
He bled and died to take away my sin:               A E B E  B

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation    E  A
And take me home- what joy shall fill my heart!     A E B E
Then shall i bow in humble adoration                E  A
And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art!     A E B E  B
