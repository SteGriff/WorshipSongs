G                 D             Em
We want to see jesus lifted high
                C                     G
A banner that flies accross this land
                    D                     Em
Then all men might see the truth and know
            C
He is the way to heaven

Chorus:
G
We want to see
D
We want to see
Em             C
We want to see Jesus lifted high

Bridge:
G        D                   Em
Step by step we're moving foward
              D                Em
Little by little taking ground
        D                      Em
Every prayer, a powerful weapon
             C              D
Strongholds come tumblin' down and down and down and down
