IN CHRIST ALONE - C

   F       C       F        G
In Christ alone my hope is found,
C/E      F           G          C     
He is my light, my strength, my song;
     F     C           F       G  
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
C/E               F        G          C
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
     C/E        F         C/E       G
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
     C/E       F             C/E      G
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
   F     C       F      G
My Comforter, my All in All,
C/E         F        G        C
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! Who took on flesh        F   C  F   G
Fulness of God in helpless babe!          C/E F  G   C
This gift of love and righteousness       F   C  F   G 
Scorned by the ones he came to save:      C/E F  G   C  
Till on that cross as Jesus died,         C/E F  C/E G
The wrath of God was satisfied            C/E F  C/E G 
For every sin on Him was laid;            F   C  F   G
Here in the death of Christ I live.       C/E F  G   C
            
There in the ground His body lay          F   C  F   G
Light of the world by darkness slain:     C/E F  G   C
Then bursting forth in glorious Day       F   C  F   G 
Up from the grave he rose again!          C/E F  G   C 
And as He stands in victory               C/E F  C/E G
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,      C/E F  C/E G          
For I am His and He is mine               F   C  F   G
Bought with the precious blood of Christ. C/E F  G   C

No guilt in life, no fear in death,       F   C  F   G
This is the power of Christ in me;        C/E F  G   C
From life's first cry to final breath.    F   C  F   G 
Jesus commands my destiny.                C/E F  G   C 
No power of hell, no scheme of man,       C/E F  C/E G
Can ever pluck me from His hand;          C/E F  C/E G 
Till He returns or calls me home,         F   C  F   G
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.   C/E F  G   C
