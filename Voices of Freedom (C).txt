VOICES OF FREEDOM (C)
(F Am G)
             F
My heart was captured
            Am
Sin held me captive
             G
Now cause of You God I'm set free
            F
I feel like dancing
             Am
I can't help moving
           G
I got this crazy joy creeping up in me

  F - G - Am
  Wo- o - oah,   Let's wake the city up
  F - G - C
  Wo- o - oah
             F
    When the crowds go home
            Am
    And the hype dies down
            G
    We will sing 'cause we're unashamed
                       F
    Just like Paul and Silas
                      Am
    We're not staying quiet
                G
    Whenever we praise
                           C        (F, G, Am)
    We sing with voices of freedom  x2

            F
You give me purpose
              Am
You keep Your promise
            G
I hear Your Spirit call to me
          F
To be the difference
            Am
To live for Jesus
           G
To shine a light now for all to see

               F  G  Am
  Whatever the calling
               F  G  C
  Whatever the moment
        G
  We'll sing
               F  G  Am                G (Fade)
  Whatever the calling    Whatever the moment
  We'll sing with voices of freedom
