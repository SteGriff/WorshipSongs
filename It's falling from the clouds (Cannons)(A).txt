A                     E
It's falling from the clouds
Bm                   F#m
A strange and lovely sound
D                A           E
I hear it in the thunder and rain
A                   E
It's ringing in the sky
Bm                  F#m
Like cannons in the night
	D            A        E
The music of the universe plays

         A             D
Singing, You are holy, great and mighty
F#m                      E
The moon and the stars, declare who you are
	A                D
I'm so unworthy, but still you love me
	F#m                E
For-ever my heart will sing of how great you are

A             E
beautiful and free
Bm                F#m
the song of galax-ies
D                 A                E
It's reaching far beyond the Milky Way
A                      E
Let's join in with the sound
Bm                    F#m
Come on let's sing it loud
	   D            A        E
As the music of the universe plays

D                          A    E
All glory, honor, power is yours amen
D                          A    E
All glory, honor, power is yours amen
Bm                         F#m    			Esus    E
All glory, honor, power is yours forever amen
