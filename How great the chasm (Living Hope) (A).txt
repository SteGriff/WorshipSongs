LIVING HOPE - PHIL WICKHAM (E)

              A                E
How great the chasm that lay between us
             D        F#m            E
How high the mountain   I could not climb
        A                  E
In desperation I turned to heaven
               D      E      A
And spoke your name into the night
                 D                    A
Then through the darkness your loving kindness
                 F#m            E
Tore through the shadows of my soul
            A                   E
The work is finished the end is written
      D         E      A
Jesus Christ my Living Hope
 
           A                 E
Who could imagine so great a mercy
                 D      F#m                E
What heart could fathom    such boundless grace
           A                      E
The God of Ages stepped down from Glory
           D       E       A
To wear my sin and bear my shame
               D             A
The cross has spoken I am forgiven
            F#m                 E
The King of Kings calls me His own
          A                   E
Beautiful Savior Iâ€™m yours forever
      D         E      A
Jesus Christ my Living Hope
 
		 D  A              E              F#m
	Hallelu-jah praise the One who set me free
		 D  A             E                F#m
	Hallelu-jah death has lost its grip on me
			 D            A                E              F#m
	You have broken every chain there's salvation in your Name
		  D         E      A
	Jesus Christ my Living Hope
 
              A                       E
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            D    F#m          E
Your buried body    began to breathe
           A                   E
Out of the silence the Roaring Lion
             D            E        A (or F#m)
Declared the grave has no claim on me
[
		  D            E    A
	Jesus Yours is the victory   (to Chorus)
