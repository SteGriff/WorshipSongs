Oh, wonderful love!
            
It’s so high you can’t get over it,
So low you can’t get under it,
So wide you can’t get round it,
Oh, wonderful love!

So deep you can't go through it,
So long you can't see the end of it,
So strong you can't resist it,
Oh, wonderful love!

Refrain

So bright you have to see it,
So loud you have to hear it,
So sweet you have to taste it,
Oh, wonderful love!
