ON CHRIST THE SOLID ROCK I STAND

G          D7    G  C  D7    G
My hope is built on no-thing less
C           G         A7        D 
than Jesus' blood and righteous-ness;
G        D7  G   C   D7 G
no merit of  my  own I  claim
C          G     Em  A  D7   G
but wholly trust in  Je-sus' name

	C             G     D       G
	On Christ the solid rock, I stand
	G         C      Em  D    D7  G
	all other ground is  sink-ing sand
	G         C      Em  D    D7  G
	all other ground is sinking sand

When weary in this earthly race     G  D7  G-C  D7-G
I rest on His unchanging grace;     C   G  A7  D
in every wild and stormy gale       G  D7  G-C  D7-G
my anchor holds and will not fail   C   G  Em D G

His vow, His covenant and blood     G  D7  G-C  D7-G
are my defence against the flood    C   G  A7  D
when earthly hopes are swept away   G  D7  G-C  D7-G
He will uphold me on that day       C   G  Em D G

When the last trumpet's voice shall sound  G  D7  G-C  D7-G
O may I then in Him be found!              C   G  A7  D
clothed in His righteousness alone,        G  D7  G-C  D7-G
faultless to stand before His throne       C   G  Em D G
