Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns

All music but  its own

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him who died for thee

And rose victorious in the strife

For those He came to save

His glories now we sing

Who died and rose on high

Those wounds yet visi-ble above 
     G    Asus   G
In beauty glori-fied
     C              F  
No angel in the sky
      D              G
Can fully bear that sight,
      C       F         G7      C  
But downward bends His burning eye

At mysteries so bright.

Whose power a scepter sways

From pole to pole, that wars may cease

And all be prayer and praise
      C                  F  
His reign shall know no end
      D                G
And round His pierced feet
        C        F    G7    C  
Fair flowers of para-dise extend    
         F       G7    C
Their fragrance ever sweet.
