He's coming on the clouds   kings and kingdoms will bow down
Am                                           Dm        F
Every chain will break  as broken hearts declare His praise

Who can stop the Lord Almighty

                                              C/E         F
     For the sins of the world     His blood breaks the chains
                          G                           F
     And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb

    Am                                          Dm        F
The God who comes to save   is here to set the captives free
