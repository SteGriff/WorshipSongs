CROWN HIM WITH MANY CROWNS (B)

B               G#m    E                
Crown Him with many crowns
     B    E         F#7
The Lamb upon His throne
      B         G#m      C#      F#         
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns 
      F#   Gsus      F#
All music but  its own
  B                  E    
Awake, my soul, and sing 
    C#                F#
Of Him who died for thee
     B       E         F#7      B                   
And hail Him as thy matchless King

Through all e - ter – ni - ty

Crown Him the Lord of life
        B      E        F#7
Who triumphed o’er the grave
      B     G#m      C#        F#         
And rose victorious in the strife
      F#      Gsus     F#
For those He came to save
       B            E  
His glories now we sing
     C#                F#
Who died and rose on high
     B      E     F#7       B  
Who died eternal life to bring
      E         F#7        B
And lives that death may die

B              G#m      E                
Crown Him the Lord of love
  B          E        F#7
Behold His hands and side
        B         G#m   C#    F#         
Those wounds yet visi-ble above 
     F#    Gsus   F#
In beauty glori-fied
     B              E  
No angel in the sky
      C#                F#
Can fully bear that sight,
      B          E    F#7        B  
But downward bends His burning eye
         E   F#7   B
At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of peace

Whose power a scepter sways
      B       G#m         C#         F#         
From pole to pole, that wars may cease
     F#     Gsus         F#
And all be prayer and praise
      B                  E  
His reign shall know no end
      C#                F#
And round His pierced feet
        B        E    F#7    B  
Fair flowers of para-dise extend    
         E       F#7    B
Their fragrance ever sweet.

The Potentate of time,

Creator of the rolling spheres,
  F#  Gsus F#
Ineffably sublime!
     B              E   
All hail Redeemer, hail
     C#                F#
For Thou hast died for me
     B          E    F#7        B  
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
         E   F#7   B
Through-out eter-nity
