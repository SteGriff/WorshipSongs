FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD (C)

			Am
I surrender all
					F            C		F
I'm living for Your glory on the earth

This passion in my heart
This stirring in my soul
To see the nations bow
For all the world to know
I'm living for Your glory on the earth

For every voice to cry out

Burn like a fire in me

For every tongue to confess
				  C
You alone are the King
						G
You are the hope of the earth
