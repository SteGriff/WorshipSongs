IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER (D)

D               Bm      Em               Em    A
In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
D                   Bm    Em    A      D
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
G                Bm            D    Em  A
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on  snow,
D               Bm      Em   A   D
In the bleak midwinter, lo - ong ago.

D                      Bm        Em           Em    A
Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
D                      Bm        Em      A        D
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
G               Bm       D      Em    A
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
D              Bm      Em   A    D
The Lord God Almighty, Je - esus Christ.

  D              Bm     Em                A
  Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
  D            Bm       Em   A         D
  Cherubim and seraphim thro-onged the air;
  G              Bm    D      Em     A
  But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
  D              Bm      Em   A    D
  Worshipped the beloved wi - th a kiss.
  
  D          Bm        Em        A
  What can I give Him, poor as I am?
  D           Bm        Em      A       D
  If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
  G           Bm        D       Em    A
  If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
      D            Bm        Em   A     D
  Yet what I can I give Him: gi - ve my heart.
