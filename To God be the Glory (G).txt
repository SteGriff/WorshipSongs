TO GOD BE THE GLORY (E)

   G                       D              G
To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
   C            G             A           D
So loved He the world that He gave us His son
    G                    D            G
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
    C          G    D     G            D  G
And opened the Life gates that all may go in

	G                                                        D
	Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice,
	D                                                  G
	Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice,
	D7  G                           D         G
	Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
		C            G   D   G               D    G
	And give Him the glo-ry, great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,   G     D  G
To ev'ry believer the promise of God;            C  G  A  D
The vilest offender who truly believes,          G     D  G
That moment from Jesus a pardon receieves.       C  G-D-G  D  G

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.
