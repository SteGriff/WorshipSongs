Set a fire down in my soul,
that I can't contain, that I can't control.
I want more of you, God.
I want more of you, God.

There's no place I'd rather be,
there's no place I'd rather be,
there's no place I'd rather be
than here in your love, here in your love.

Pull me a little closer
Take me a little deeper
I want to know Your heart
I want to know Your heart
‘Cause Your love is so much sweeter
Than anything I’ve tasted
I want to know Your heart
I want to know Your heart
