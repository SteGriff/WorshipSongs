THE LORD’S MY SHEPHERD (C)

		      C	        Gsus	 C
The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want;
			C		F		Gsus	G
He makes me lie in pastures green.
            F      Gsus         C    Am7
He leads me by the still, still wa - ters,
    Dm7		 Gsus		 C
His goodness restores my soul.

			   C        Gsus  C 
	And I will trust in You  alone,
			   C        Gsus  C
	And I will trust in You  alone,
			 F       Gsus  C       Am7
	For Your endless mercy follows me,
		 Dm7           Gsus    C
	Your goodness will lead me home.

		      C	        Gsus	 C
He guides my ways in righteousness,
		  C		  F		    Gsus	G
And He anoints my head with oil,
       F       Gsus   C          Am7
And my cup, it over - flows with joy,
    Dm7		   Gsus	   C
I feast on His pure de-lights.

		     C	      Gsus	  C
And though I walk the darkest path,
           C        F    Gsus  G
I will not fear the evil one,
            F        Gsus     C       Am7
For You are with me, and Your rod and staff
        Dm7       Gsus    C
Are the comfort I need to know.
