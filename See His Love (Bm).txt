See His Love
Tim Hughes

Intro:
Bm  G  A  F#m  (1 time)

Verse:
Bm                   A
See His love nailed onto a cross
            G                       A    
Perfect and blameless life given as sacrifice
Bm                       A
See Him there all in the name of love
            G                    A
Broken yet glorious, all for the sake of us


Chorus:
Bm            G
This is Jesus in His glory
A              F#m
King of Heaven dying for me
Bm              G
It is finished, He has done it
A                F#m           Bm
Death is beaten, Heaven bekons me


2nd Verse:
Bm                   A
Greater love now one could ever show
         G                     A    
Mercy so undeserved, freedom I should not know
Bm                    A
All my sin, all of my hidden shame
              G                      A
Died with Him on the cross, eternity won for us
(Chorus)


Coda:
Bm         A/C#
Such love, such love
F#m                   G
Such love is this for me
