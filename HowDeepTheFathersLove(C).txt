HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE FOR US (C)

     C                 Dm   C  F        C               Amsus-G
How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
     C                  Dm-C  F       C                G    C
That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure
                       Dm-C     F        C                 Am    G
How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned his face away
    C                    Dm-C   F          C           G   C
As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring many sons to glory

(C - Dm - C - F - C - G) 

     C         Dm   C  F        C               Amsus-G
Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders
 C                  Dm-C     F         C             G    C
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers
                    Dm   C     F    C             Am    G
It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished
    C                    Dm  C   F       C               G   C
His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished

(C - Dm - C - F - C - G - C)

 C                  Dm C  F        C                 Amsus-G
I will not boast in anything: no gifts, no power, no wisdom
  C                  Dm-C   F          C             G    C
But I will boast in Jesus Christ; his death and resurrection
                        Dm  C  F      C             Am G
Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer
    C                 Dm  C   F          C                 G   C
But this I know with all my heart: his wounds have paid my ransom
