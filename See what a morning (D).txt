with the dawning of hope in Jerusalem
D           A/D            G                 D
folded the grave clothes, tomb filled with light

as the angels announce Christ is risen!

borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,

 fulfilled in Christ, the Man,

for He lives: Christ is risen from the dead

See Mary weeping, "Where is he Laid"?
A     Bm  G       D/F# G         D/A   A
As in sor-row she turns from the empty tomb;
D             A/D       G           D
Hears a voice speaking, calling her name;
A/C#     Bm  G        D/F# G         D/A   A     A7/G
It's the Mas-ter, the Lord raised to life again!

 The voice that spans the years, speaking life,

Stirring hope, bringing peace to us,
D                A/G  G  D/F#
 Will sound till he   ap-pears,
G      D/F#   G       D/A     A        D     (A G D)
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!

One with the Father, Ancient of Days,
A           Bm  G       D/F#    G          D/A   A
Through the Spi-rit who clothes faith with cer-tainty
D          A/D       G         D
Honour and blessing, glory and praise
A/C#   Bm   G            D/F#  G      D/A  A   A7/G
To the King crowned with power and au-thority!
D              A/G  G     D/F#  G        D/F#
  And we are raised with Him,   Death is dead, 
G        D/F#   G          D/A    A      A/G  D/F#
love has won,   Christ has con - quered;

 And we shall reign with Him
G      D/F#   G       D/A     A        D     (A G D)
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!
