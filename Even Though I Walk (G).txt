EVEN THOUGH I WALK/YOU NEVER LET GO - G

              G
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
     Em
Your perfect love is casting out fear.
                  G
And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life,
  Em
I won't turn back, I know You are near.

  And I will fear no e  -  vil,
                C  D  G
  For my God is wi - th me.
                   C  D  G
  And if my God is wi - th me,
                    D
  Whom then shall I fear?
                    C
  Whom then shall I fear?

    G                                                              G
    Oh no, You never let go,                  Yes, I can see a light that is coming
    G                                         G
    Through the calm and through the storm    for the heart that holds on,
    Em                                                             Em
    Oh no, You never let go,                  And there will be an end to these troubles,
    Em                                        Em
    In every high and every low               but until that day comes,
    D                                         D
    O no, You never let go                    Still I will praise You,
    C                            G   D 	   C                       G  D
    Lord, You never let go of me.             Still I will praise You.

                G
And I can see a light

that is coming for the heart that holds on
  Em
A glorious light beyond all compare.
                     G
And there will be an end

to these troubles, but until that day comes,
      Em
We'll live to know You're here on the earth.
