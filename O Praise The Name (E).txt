O Praise The Name (E)

         E
I cast my mind to Calvary
            B             C#m
Where Jesus bled and died for me
          A                    B
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
          B           E        G#m  A
My Saviour on that cursed tree

         E                          
His body bound and drenched in tears
              B              C#m
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
             A             B
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
       B               E     G#m  A
Messiah still and all alone

	  E                      A        E
	O Praise the Name of the Lord our God
	  C#m                 Bsus4  B        
	O Praise His Name forever - more
		B                   A         C#m         
	For endless days, we will sing Your praise
	   A        Bsus4 B   E      G#m   A
	Oh Lord, oh Lord  our God

           E                      
Then on the third, at break of dawn
           B          C#m
The Son of heaven rose again
           A                 B          
O trampled death, where is your sting
          B                   E     
The angels roar for Christ the King

	  E               B    A        E
	O Praise the Name of the Lord our God
	  C#m                 Bsus4  B        
	O Praise His Name forever - more
		B                   A         C#m         
	For endless days, we will sing Your praise
	   A        Bsus4 B   E     
	Oh Lord, oh Lord  our God

           E
He shall return in robes of white
            B                 C#m
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
           A            B
And I will rise among the saints
           B                E
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
