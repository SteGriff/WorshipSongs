ONCE AGAIN (D)

D     A         G               D 
Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
G          D        G             A
You became nothing, poured out to death
D    A          G                D
Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life
    G           A          D      D/F#
And I'm in that place once again
G           A           D
I'm in that place once again

		D            G             D               A
	And once again I look upon the cross where You died
		D               G             D         A
	I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken in-side
	Bm           G
	Once again I thank You
	Bm            A          G    A   D
	Once again I pour out my life

D       A      G            D
Now You are ex-alted to the highest place
G           D              G            A
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow
D       A      G              D
But for now, I marvel at Your saving grace
    G           A           D       D/F#
And I'm full of praise once again
G           A           D
I'm full of praise once again

G                   A
Thank You for the cross
D                   
Thank You for the cross
G                   A         D
Thank You for the cross, my Friend
