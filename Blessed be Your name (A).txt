BLESSED BE YOUR NAME - G

G        D                   Em            C
Blessed be Your name  in the land that is plentiful
           G          D               C
Where Your streams of abundance flow  Blessed be Your name
G            D                       Em           C
 And blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
         G                 D           C
Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name

G
 Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise 
G                     D               Em             C
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say

(Chorus)              
                  G           D 
   Blessed be the name of the Lord
                   Em       C
   Blessed be Your name
                  G           D
   Blessed be Your name of the Lord
                   Em    D  C
   Blessed be Your glorious name

G        D                      Em            C  
 Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
         G               D              C 
When the world's "all as it should be"  Blessed be Your name
G            D                    Em               C
 And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering 
               G           D         C
Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name

    G              D
You give and take away
    Em             C
You give and take away
    G                   D
My heart will choose to say
      Em               C
Lord, blessed be Your name
