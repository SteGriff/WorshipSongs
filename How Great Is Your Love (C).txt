How Great Is Your Love (C)
         C
From the darkness  I called Your Name
     G
Into darkness Your mercy came
              F             Am
You called me out Lifted me up
                  G
How great is Your love

             C
You bore my weakness You took my shame
          G
Buried my burdens in fields of grace
               F            Am
You called me out Lifted me up
                   G
How great is Your love

	C
	From the heights of Heaven, You stepped down to earth
	G
	Innocent perfection, Gave Your life for us
	F              Am
	We are amazed, We stand in awe
		G
	For we have been changed by the power of the Cross

			C
		How great, How great, How great is Your love 
			G
		How great, How great, How great is Your love 
			Am                                           F

        C
In Your kindness You lead me home
        G
In Your presence where I belong
              F             Am
You called me out Lifted me up
                  G
How great is Your love

	Am                  F
	There has never been There will never be
	C             G
