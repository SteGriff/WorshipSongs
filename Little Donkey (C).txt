LITTLE DONKEY (C)

C              F
Little donkey, little donkey
C          G
On a dusty road
C              F     
Got to keep on plodding onwards
G                 C
With the precious load

Been a long time little donkey
Through the winter's night.
Don't give up now little donkey
Bethlehem's in sight

	Am             Em
	Ring out those bells tonight
	F      G    F      G
	Bethle-hem, Bethle-hem
	Am         Em
	Follow the star tonight
	F      G    F      G
	Bethle-hem, Bethle-hem

C              F
Little donkey, little donkey
C           G
Had a heavy day
C             F
Little donkey carry Mary
G             C
Safely on her way

Little donkey, little donkey
Journey's end is near
There are wisemen waiting for a
Sign to bring them here.

Do not falter, little donkey
There's a star ahead
It will guide you, little donkey
To a cattle shed
