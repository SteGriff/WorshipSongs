King of My Heart (C)

         C                       F              C
Let the King of my heart  Be the mountain where I run
     Am               G           F     C
The fountain I drink from  Oh, He is my song.
         C                       F             C
Let the King of my heart  Be the shadow where I hide
    Am             G            F     C
The ransom for my life   Oh, He is my song.


			 Am    G    F  C
	You are good, good, oh      
			 Am    G    F  C
	You are good, good, oh     
			 Am    G    F  C
	You are good, good, oh     
			 Am    G    F  C
	You are good, good, oh     

         C                       F              C
Let the King of my heart  Be the wind inside my sails
     Am            G            F     C
The anchor in the waves  Oh, He is my song.
         C                       F              C
Let the King of my heart  Be the fire inside my veins
     Am         G           F     C
The echo of my days  Oh, He is my song.
