Written by Kevin Prosch

E                  A/E          E     B         E  A/E E
He is the Lord and He reigns on high. He is the Lord.
      E                     A/E      E      B         E  A/E E
Spoke into the darkness, created the light. He is the Lord.
       E                   A/E       E     B         E  A/E E
Who is like unto Him, neverending in days? He is the Lord.
    E                          A/E         E     
And He comes in power, when we call on His name.
B         E  A/E E
He is the Lord.

          E   A/E   E        B
Show Your power, oh Lord our God.
          E   A/E   E        B                     E  A/E E
Show Your power, oh Lord our God.  Oh Lord our God.

Your Gospel, oh Lord, is the hope for our nation.
You are the Lord.
It's the power of God for our salvation. You are the Lord.
We ask not for riches, but look to the cross. You are the Lord.
And for our inheritance give us the lost. You are the Lord.
