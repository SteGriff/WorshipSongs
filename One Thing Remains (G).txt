--Capo 4--

Verse 1:
C                   G              D
Higher than the mountains that I face
C                   G           D
Stronger than the power of the grave
C                G              D
Constant in the trial and the change
C         G  D
One thing… Remains (repeat)

Chorus:
Em                       C
Your love never fails, never gives up
 G                D
Never runs out on me (3x)

Verse 2:

On and on and on and on it goes

It overwhelms and satisfies my soul

And I never, ever, have to be afraid

One thing remains

Bridge:
    C         G        D
In death, In life, I’m confident and
Amaj7           C        G          D
covered by the power of Your great love
  C        G       D
My debt is paid, there’s nothing that can
Amaj7        C          G          D
separate my heart from Your great love
