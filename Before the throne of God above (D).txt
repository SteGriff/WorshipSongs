I have a strong, a perfect plea,

A great High Priest whose name is Love,

Who ever lives and pleads for  me.

My name is  writ-ten  on His heart;
  Bm/A        G   D/F#  A         Bm2
I know that while in    heav'n He stands
Bm Bm/A       G6     Em7    G/A  Bm
no tongue can bid me thence de - part.

            G6     Em7   G/A  D    |             G6    Em7  G/A  D
Who made an end to all   my  sin.  | the King of glory and  of   grace!

For God, the Just, is  satisfied   | My life is hid with Christ on high,
Bm Bm/A    G6      Em7   G/A  Bm   | Bm Bm/A         G6      Em7  G/A  Bm
to look on him and par - don  me.  | with Christ, my Saviour and  my   God
