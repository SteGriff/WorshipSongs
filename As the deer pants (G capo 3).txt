AS THE DEER PANTS FOR THE WATER - G - Capo 3

G       D         Em      C
As the deer pants for the water
       Am          D     G
So my soul longs after you
G     D           Em      C
You alone are my hearts desire
      Am        D     G
And I long to worship you

  Em                C           G
  You alone are my strengh ,my shield
      C                Am       B
  To you alone may my spirit yield
  G     D           Em      C
  You alone are my hearts desire
        Am        D     G
  And I long to worship you

I want you more than gold or silver
Only you can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye

You are my friend and you are my brother
Even though you are king
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything.
