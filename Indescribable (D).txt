Bm                                 A             D
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Em              Em7/D           C
Creation's revealing Your majesty
Bm                              A            D    
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
Em                           Em7/D           C
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
G2  A
All exclaiming

D              A
Indescribable, uncontainable,
G2                                                  Bm
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
A                G2
You are amazing God
D            A
All powerful, untameable,
G2                                             Bm
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
A				 G2
You are amazing God

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom

[Chorus]

D              A
Incomparable, unchangeable
G2                                                  Bm
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
A                G2
You are amazing God
A                G2
You are amazing God
