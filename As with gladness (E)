AS WITH GLADNESS (E)

(1)                                   (2)
E       B         A      E            E       B      A          E
As with gladness, men of old          As with joyful steps they sped
F#m     A       B    E                F#m     A     B      E
Did the guiding star behold           To that lowly manger bed
E       B        A          E         E        B        A    E
As with joy they hailed its light     There to bend the knee before
F#m     A       B       E             F#m      A          B     E
Leading onward, beaming bright        Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;
E                 B         C#m       E              B       C#m
So, most glorious Lord, may we        So may we with willing feet
F#m    E       A   B  E               F#m  E        A   B  E
Ever - more be led by Thee.           Ever seek Thy mer-cy seat.

E       B       A          E          E    B      A     E
As they offered gifts most rare       Holy Jesus, every day
F#m     A      B        E             F#m     A      B      E
At that manger rude and bare;         Keep us in the narrow way;
E      B       A    E                 E         B       A          E
So may we with holy joy,              And, when earthly things are past,
F#m      A         B     E            F#m       A        B        E
Pure and free from sin's alloy,       Bring our ransomed souls at last
E                 B         C#m       E                  B       C#m
All our costliest treasures bring,    Where they need no star to guide,
F#m        E         A      B  E      F#m      E          A   B  E
Christ, to Thee, our heaven-ly King.  Where no clouds Thy glo-ry hide.

E      B        A       E
In the heavenly country bright,
F#m       A      B    E
Need they no cre-ated light;
E        B          A        E
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
F#m      A         B        E
Thou its Sun which goes not down;
E             B      C#m
There forever may we sing
F#m  E     A  B   E
Alle-luias to our King!
