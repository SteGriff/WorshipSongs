All to Thee, my blessed Savior,

D            A
All to Jesus I surrender,           All to Jesus I surrender,
G             A      D              Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Humbly at His feet I bow,           Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;     Truly know that Thou art mine.
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,           All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;        Now I feel the sacred flame.
Fill me with Thy love and power,    Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Let Thy blessing fall on me.        Glory, glory to His name!
