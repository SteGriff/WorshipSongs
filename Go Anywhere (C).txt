You're the adventure of a lifetime, Jesus

You take my heart and make it wild

You are the thrill my soul is seeking, Jesus

Your grace has no horizon line

Your grace has no horizon line



Take me out beyond the waves, Lord Jesus

You are the captain of my soul

There is no map for where Your wild heart takes us

We're running into the unknown

We're running into the unknown
