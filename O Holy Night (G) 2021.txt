OH HOLY NIGHT (G)

G                 C                  G
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining; 
G                      D              G
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. 
G                     C             G 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining, 
        Bm               F#            Bm
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth. 

	D                      G
	A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices, 
		D               G
	For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. 
	Em           Bm
	Fall on your knees, 
		Am             Em
	Oh, hear the angel voices! 
	  G D     G C      G    D                 G
	O night divine, O night   when Christ was born! 
	  D      G C      G     D                 G
	O night divine, O night   when Christ was born!

G                   C              G
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, 
G                          D          G
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. 
G                C               G 
Over the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
             Bm                   F#     Bm
Now come the wisemen from out the Orient land. 

	    D                  G
	The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
		D             G
	In all our trials born to be our friend. 
	Em           Bm        Am              Em
	He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
	  G D       G C      G   D           G
	Behold your King! Before   him lowly bend! 
	  D         G C     G    D           G
	Behold your King! Before   him lowly bend! 
	
G                     C        G
Truly He taught us to love one another, 
G                        D         G
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
G                              C            G 
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother. 
           Bm       F#               Bm
And in his name all oppression shall cease. 

	      D               G
	Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
		D             G
	Let all within us praise His holy name. 
	Em            Bm      Am              Em
	Christ is the Lord! O praise his name forever, 
	    G D       G C   G  D        G
	His power and glory Ev - ermore proclaim!
	      D       G C   G  D        G
	His power and glory Ev - ermore proclaim!
