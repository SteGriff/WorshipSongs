ALL I ONCE HELD DEAR - G
(Capo 3 for Bb)

D     C     D/F# G               C   D  G
All I once held dear, built my life upon,
          C/E  C  G        Em      D
All this world reveres and wars to own;
G/B    C    D/F#    G           C/E  D/F# G
All I once thought gain I have counted loss,
          C/E  C    G       Em       Gsus D
Spent and worthless now compared to this.

	 	Em     Bm      C
	 There is no greater thing.
	 		G/B             C/E
	 You're my all, You're the best,
	 		G/D              C
	 You're my joy, my righteousness,
	 	G/B      C2/E   D   G
	 And I love You Lord.

Now my heart's desire is to know You more,
       C/E  C  G        Em      D
To be found in You and known as Yours,
G/B   C    D/F#  G           C/E  D/F# G
To possess by faith what I could not earn
      C/E  C    G      Em       Gsus D
All surpassing gift of righteousness

       C   D/F# G               C   D  G
Oh to know the power of Your risen life,
         C/E  C  G        Em    D
And to know You in Your sufferings;
G/B    C   D/F#  G           C/E  D/F# G
To become like You in Your death, my Lord,
       C/E  C   G       Em   Gsus D
So with You to live and never die.
