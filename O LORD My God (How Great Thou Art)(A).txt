HOW GREAT THOU ART

A                        D
O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder
D        A       E                   A
Consider all the works thy hand hath made,
A                           D
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
D                 A       E            A       E           
Thy power through-out the universe dis-played;

				  A        D               A
	Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
				   E    D                A     E
	How great Thou art,   how great Thou art!
				  A        D               A     F#m
	Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
				   Bm       D     E    A
	How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wander   A  D
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;       D A E A
when I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,      A  D
and hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;     D A E A  E

And when I think that God his son not sparing,      A  D
Sent him to die - I scarce can take it in,          D A E A
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing,         A  D
He bled and died to take away my sin:               D A E A  E

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation    A  D
And take me home- what joy shall fill my heart!     D A E A
Then shall i bow in humble adoration                A  D
And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art!     D A E A  E
