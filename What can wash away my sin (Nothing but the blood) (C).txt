NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD (C)

C               Am
What can wash a-way my sin
F                        G  C
Nothing but the blood of Je-sus
C                Am
What can make me whole again
F                        G  C
Nothing but the blood of Je-sus

	C
	Oh Precious is the flow
	G
	That makes me white as snow
	C    C/B  Am
	No o-ther fount I know
	F                        G  C
	Nothing but the blood of Je-sus

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Glory Glory this I sing
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
All my praise for this I bring
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
