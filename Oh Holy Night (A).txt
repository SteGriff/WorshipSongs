OH HOLY NIGHT (A)

A        A7        D                  A
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining; 
A                      E                A
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. 
A             A7         D             A 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining, 
          C#m                    G#               C#m
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth. 


	E                      A
	A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices, 
		E                A
	For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. 
	F#m           C#m
	Fall on your knees, 
		Bm               F#m
	Oh, hear the angel voices! 
	  A E     A D
	O night divine, 
	   A    E                A
	O night when Christ was born! 
	  A  E   A D
	O night divine,
	  A           E          A
	O night when Christ was born!


A          A7        D              A
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, 
A                          E          A
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. 
A         A7      D               A 
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
             C#m                  G#     C#m
Now come the wisemen from out the Orient land. 


	    E                  A
	The King of kings lay thus lowly manger; 
		E              A
	In all our trials born to be our friends. 
	F#m          C#m        Bm               F#m
	He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
	  A E       A D
	Behold your King! 
	   A        E     A
	Before him lowly bend! 
	  A E       A D
	Behold your King! 
	   A        E     A
	Before him lowly bend! 


A        A7           D          A
Truly He taught us to love one another, 
A                        E         A
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
A               A7             D             A 
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother. 
           C#m        G#             C#m
And in his name all oppression shall cease. 


	      E                 A
	Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
		E              A
	Let all within us praise His holy name. 
	F#m           C#m     Bm               F#m
	Christ is the Lord! O praise his name forever, 
	    A E        A D
	His power and glory 
	A      E      A
	Ever - more proclaim!
	    A E        A D
	His power and glory, 
	A      E      A
	Ever - more proclaim!
