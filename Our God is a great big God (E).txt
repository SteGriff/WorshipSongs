OUR GOD IS A GREAT BIG GOD (E)

	E            A
	Our God is a great big God
	E            F#m7       B7 
	Our God is a great big God
	E            A 
	Our God is a great big God

	And He holds us in His hands

[Chorus]

     B 
He's higher than a skyscraper
     A                   E
He's deeper than a subma-rine
     B
He's wider than the universe
       A               E
And be-yond my wildest dreams
         C#m               G#m
And He's known me and He's loved me
         A                 E
Since be-fore the world be-gan
    A            E/G#           F#m7          B
How wonderful to be  a  part of God's amazing plan!
