	Anyone like You

  G                           F                 C
I know, I don't deserve, this love You have for me
    G                         F          C
You gave, yourself for us, to die upon a tree
    F                  C/E     G/B      Am
And sometimes when I'm feeling far from You
  F               Dm7    
I hear Your voice calling me 
    F          Gsus G
And I begin to sing

	[Chorus]

  G                       F             C
I know, You'll always be, with me every-day
     G              F              C
Your Spirit, in me, showing me the way
    F             C/E    G/B             Am
And I will try to be the best that I can be
 F                 Dm7
'Cause I know Your love for me
   F               Gsus G
Is deeper than the sea
