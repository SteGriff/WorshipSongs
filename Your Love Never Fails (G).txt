Em  	         C

Your love never fails
Em  	           C
	I know I still make mistakes, but

Chorus:
C             G                   D  
You stay the same through the ages
Am                 C
Your love never changes
             G                     D                Am       C
There maybe pain in the night but joy comes in the morning

And when the oceans rage
         Am            C
I don't have to be afraid
          G                  D   
Because I know that You love me

Your love never fails    

C Em D x2

The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails
The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
But Your love never fails

           C           Em                    D  Dsus4  D
You make, all things, work together for my good.
