LIVING FOR YOUR GLORY (C)

Am                          C
What good is it to gain the whole world
         F
But lose your soul?
Am                        C
What good is it to make a sweet sound
      F
But remain proud?

  Dm Am            G F
  In view of God’s mercy
  Dm Am      G
  I offer my all

	F                      G           Am

The road I’m on it leads nowhere without you
And the life I live it finds meaning, in surrender
