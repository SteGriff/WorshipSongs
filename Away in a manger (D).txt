AWAY IN A MANGER (D)

D                         D             G
Away  in  a  manger,  No  crib  for  a  bed,
     G       A      D           Em                A
The  little  Lord  Jesus,  Lay  down  his  sweet  head.
    D                                   F#m              G
The stars  in  the  bright  sky, Looked down  where  he  lay
     G       A     D       Em          A7   D
The  little  Lord  Jesus,  Asleep  on  the  hay.


D                          D     G
The cattle are lowing, The baby awakes;
     G     A    D         Em        A
But little Lord Jesus, No crying he makes.
  D                           F#m           G
I love thee, Lord Jesus, Look down from the sky,
    G       A  D           Em      A7  D
And stay by my side, until morning is  nigh.


D                        D           G
Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay,
      G     A   D         Em        A
Close by me for ever, And love me I pray.
      D                         F#m        G
Bless all the dear children, In thy tender care,
    G      A   D           Em       A7   D
And fit us for heaven, To live with thee there.
